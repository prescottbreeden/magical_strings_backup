Hi Philip-

Happy Easter!  I've been taking harp lessons for the past several months.
I recently stopped because I'm not happy with the harp.  The sound isn't a
pleasant sound to my ears and I stopped practicing and playing all
together.

I want to return the harp to you.  Please let me know the next step.

Thank you,
Jenny Solomon
