Hi Pam & Philip,
                          Hope you and yours are all well. We’re fine here
in Baltimore and slowly getting used to the fact
that the summer is now over.
We received your wonderful double cd a few days ago and are listening to
your music in the car all the time.
Thanks so much for sending it over. It’s lovely to have a tangible
reminder of a “magical” evening spent playing together.
I hope that you will visit Baltimore again in the not too distant future.

Sandra is having a much deserved break in Spain visiting her parents.
Meanwhile I’m slowly getting around to some of the winter jobs that need
doing around the house.

I’m glad you’re enjoying my cd. I’m hoping to do one with some of my own
songs this winter (but I’ve said that before).

Look after yourselves,

                                    Best regards,

                                                         Ronnie.
