Hi Phillip,  thank you so much for getting back to me. Yes,  Gwen is a
wonderful teacher and friend. It was lucky for me to connect with her.
I would love to arrange to come down prior to your ship date and try out
both the Oladion and Tristy. And also probably should talk about material.
My schedule is pretty flexible, so if you give me a couple time and date
options that work for you, I should be able to meet up.
Hope to see you soon, Mary
Ps I know that Tuesday Sept 6th,  would not work (just FYI)
