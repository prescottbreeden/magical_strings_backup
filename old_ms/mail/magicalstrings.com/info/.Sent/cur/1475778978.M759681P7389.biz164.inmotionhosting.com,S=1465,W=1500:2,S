Hi Phillip,
I hope you and Pam are well! Since I could not attend harp camp this year
I am going to Dusty Strings harp symposium this weekend. I am taking my
beautiful midsize Koa harp. I anticipate it will generate interest and
will direct anyone with questions/ interest in your harps to your website.
I hope it sends some business your way.
See you at Celtic Yuletide in a Portland.
Let me know if you have any interest or time in doing an even in Vancouver
in the coming months.
God Bless!
(George and) Susan Vaughan
