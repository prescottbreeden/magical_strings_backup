                                     2016 FAR-West Conference











Look for regular updates over the next few days before the conference! See
you very soon!



PGS Floor Access: We will be using two floors for PGS performances. Access
between the floors will be by elevator and stairways at either end of the
corridor. Please don't congregate and talk outside active PGS rooms. Take
conversations into the elevator foyer or the Instrument Check room.



Instrument Check rooms: There will be a room on each PGS floor where you
can leave your instruments; however, they will not be monitored this year.
Please keep the hallways open for passing and don't leave your instruments
in the halls.



Tote bag stuffing: If you are at the hotel on Thursday afternoon at 3:30,
join us for tote bag stuffing in the Evergreen foyer. If some folks bring
instruments and play during the stuffing, it will make the time go by more
enjoyably!



Registration: will open on Thursday at about 4:00 pm in the Evergreen foyer.



Conference badges: Much of our conference takes place in areas where the
general public will have access. Since conference events are only open to
registered attendees, we ask that you wear your badge to all events so you
can easily be identified.



Radio Submit: One of our 2016 Media Partners, Radio Submit, will have a
coupon in your tote bag for musicians and agents/managers/promoters. The
coupon is 50% off and cannot be combined with any other offers. When
signing up for an account, you will need to put in the code (50folk2016)
to get the discount. Offer is only good for new accounts (one per
customer) and will apply for whatever length of time you initially sign up
for. 50% off is a great value for the artists and especially for promoters
who have multiple artists. Also, three members of Radio Submit will be at
the FAR-West conference in the networking center and on various panels in
case you want to say hello.  Radio Submit is also hosting our 2015 and
2016 Official Showcase compilation for their radio members.
