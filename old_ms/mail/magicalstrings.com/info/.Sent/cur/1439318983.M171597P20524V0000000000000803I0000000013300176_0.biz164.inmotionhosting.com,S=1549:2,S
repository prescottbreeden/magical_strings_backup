Good morning my Friend...I hope you are somewhat recovered from the
weekend. It was so good to have you on board...we aught to be able to find
some excuse for you to come before next  August!
I gave Carolyn Cheney the harp stand I had on hand so she could display
her harp.  She mentioned she had purchased an instructional DVD at harp
camp and didn't want to ask you for one at the booth for fear you'd want
to sell from it as a demo.
At any rate knowing your busy schedule ...Why don't I give her mine...I
can use my daughter's and you can replace mine when your schedule is less
hectic...how does that sound?
Have a safe journey. We send you both our love ....Herb
