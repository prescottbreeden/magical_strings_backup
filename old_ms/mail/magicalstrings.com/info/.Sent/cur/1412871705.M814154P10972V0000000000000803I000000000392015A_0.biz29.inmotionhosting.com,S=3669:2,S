Hi Philip,

There are complications with the baby.

I tried the new links and they don't work either.





Peace,

Hi Ray,



Thanks for updating the website!  I just got this email from Sandra
pointing out some faulty links, see her corrections below.



We heard about Casey’s baby (Pam, from a colleague at Brightwater
school) – Wow – congratulations!  I hope everything’s going ok.



Love,

Philip

Hi Pam,

I just looked at the website on my phone and Ray has made the changes.
Unfortunately, the links for Kent and Icicle Creek do not work (I checked
them yesterday before sending). They both sell their tickets at
app.arts-people.com <http://app.arts-people.com>  so I am wondering if
that website made some changes the messed up the links.

After going to the page just now, it appears the link for Kent should be
https://app.arts-people.com/index.php?actions=8
<https://app.arts-people.com/index.php?actions=8&p=1> &p=1

The link for Icicle Creek should be
https://app.arts-people.com/index.php?actions=50
<https://app.arts-people.com/index.php?actions=50&p=3> &p=3

The changes need to be on the home page as well as on
http://magicalstrings.com/YT_2014.html


Can you forward this information to Ray? I can't seem to find his email
around here. Did you or Philip ever hear back from him? I'll be leaving
soon, but should be home a little after 8:00.

Sandra
