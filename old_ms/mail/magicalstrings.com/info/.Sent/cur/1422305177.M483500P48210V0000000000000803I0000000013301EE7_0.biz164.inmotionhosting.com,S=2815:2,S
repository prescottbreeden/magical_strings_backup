Subject: RE: Contact - Tristy harp, sound clips

Thanks for inquiring Roberta-
It came to my attention just recently that those sound clips for the lap
harps didn't work- I will contact our webmaster now about that.  You can
hear a wire-strung version of the Oladion (similar tone and size to the
Tristy) here:  http://www.magicalstrings.com/R-GoodPeopleAll.html
Cost of nylon or wire is the same; nylon is more common, warmer sound,
easier to tune, whereas wire is more haunting, ancient, ringing tone.
I'm making a rough guess of $150 to ship to Alberta.

I'll get back about the other sound clips!
Thanks again,
Philip
