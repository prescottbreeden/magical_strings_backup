Comment Please add my e/mail address to your list for updates. It was a pleasure to join you at the "House Concert" on the 19th, and especially the chance to chat with each of you. I look forward to getting tickets for my son and fiance'(in Seattle) to attend your Christmas concert this year. Best wishes to you both in your travels and music making far and wide.
