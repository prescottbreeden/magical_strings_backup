Hi Pam and Philip,
 
My office needs the W-9 I sent you earlier this week.  If you haven't
already mailed it, please bring it with you Monday night.  You may have
already heard from Annie too.
 
Looking forward to Monday.  Dan Davison, composer of Wind That Shakes the
Barley will be there and we'll start with his piece at 7:00.
 
Cheers,
 
Paul
