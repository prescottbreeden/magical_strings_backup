Hi Philip and Pam...I wanted to thank you once again for the dulcimer.  I
would liked to have come to camp...to learn...next year!
I am feeling quite well really though my feathers have been clipped and I
won't be taking any trips for awhile. Perhaps we can visit you at Magic
Hill when you return.
Have a wonderful,creative and restorative trip....creation will soon be
graced with beautiful new music..the music of the spheres....
Take Care....Safe Journey...Our Best to You....Herb & Nikki
