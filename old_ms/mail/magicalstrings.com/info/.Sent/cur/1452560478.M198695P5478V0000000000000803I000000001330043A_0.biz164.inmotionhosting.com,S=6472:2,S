Yes, February is just fine!  In fact, if you want to make Donna's first, I
know she is really chomping at the bit.  At least I still have the rental
harp... I'm just happy knowing it is coming some day :)

We just had a death in the family today, so I'll need to get back to you in
a few days regarding a lesson.  Not sure if and when we might need to go
back to California.

Take care,
Joyce

Thanks for your message!  I had a feeling you and Donna would like the case<br>
color- good deal!<br>
I&#39;m actually just getting rolling and organized in the shop for the next<br>
several harp orders, of which yours has top priority- so my rough estimate<br>
is early Feb for completion of your koa harp, does that sound ok?  And we<br>

Glad to hear about the harp circle- yes, I need to do one here, I agree...<br>
just too many irons in the fire at the moment (also trying to book our<br>

Hi, Philip. Just wanted to let you know that I met up with Mike Saunders<br>
last week and saw a swatch of the purple fabric he can order for the harp<br>
cases.  I sent a photo to Donna, and both of us love it, so we shall have<br>
our purple cases :)<br>
<br>
Just wanted to check in with you on when you think my harp may be ready, as<br>
I would love to set up a lesson, and if the harp is still a few weeks out, I<br>
would rather not wait to set up time for a lesson with you. And then I would<br>
like to schedule regular lessons :)<br>
<br>
By the way, I went to my first harp circle yesterday (in Tumwater) and had a<br>
wonderful time playing with other harpers.  We really need to have a harp<br>
circle in Gig Harbor or - Ollala ;)<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Joyce<br>
