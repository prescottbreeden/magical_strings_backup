Hi Philip...and Pam too!  We suspect you had a great trip east and are now
getting ready for your trip to my ancestral homeland...
I had a couple quick questions before I embark on my new career as a
luthier....!!!  Before I attempt a harp I discover I have plans for a
hammered dulcimer....it doesn't scare me as much as the harp....
I found an outfit in Astoria OR that sells supplies...What I don't know is
what size tuning pins....hitch pins.. and wire? Also the wire rod atop the
bridges looks like welding rod but I'm sure it isn't!  My plans said I
could use coat hanger wire for the latter but that seems somewhat
pedestrian.
I think boat building will prove easier and I do have plans for another!
Please answer my queries only if you have an abundance of time...
My Very Best to you both... Herb
