Hi Sweetie--

This message was stuck, just now got it-- Morgan came today with mirrors,
put one in, but the other was too short; gone back to Bremerton to pick up
another.  Brittany called to say she had an extra ticket for Tacoma; I
will try to come... looking forward to the opera tonight, but will miss
you terribly.  Brittany is calling Kenzie about extra ticket; see what
happens.

Love you tons,
P
