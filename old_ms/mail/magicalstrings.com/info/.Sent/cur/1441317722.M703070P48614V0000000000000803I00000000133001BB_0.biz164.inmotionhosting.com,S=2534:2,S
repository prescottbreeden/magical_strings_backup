Hi Sandra,
We just had our first good sleep since Tuesday night (that wasn't all that
great either
So we are awake at 9:40 PM having gone to sleep (although were intending a
short nap) around 4PM.

We never managed the newsletter before departing. If you have a moment
could you put the Baltimore concert photos from our facebook page on the
constant contact page and copy Philip's newsletter paragraph and dates of
classes and concert window info. When I have time tomorrow I'll play with
it, but if you could set it up from there it would be so helpful.
Thanks,
Pam
