Hi Philip....I am enjoying the dulcimer no end!
Harp...Dulcimer...Piano...Banjo...I'm like a mosquito in a nudist
camp....I know what I want to do but I don't know where to start!
I wanted you to know that the angiogram results were quite
surprising....It turns out I have significant blockages...2 main arteries
at 90% another at 70-80%.  The cardiologist was quite shocked...he didn't
understand how I could do so well on past stress tests...I see the surgeon
today at 2pm and I'll find out the next step.
I have experienced a  "different" feeling this summer but never any
pain..I thought I had better check it out....smart move!
Did you sell more harps?I think I remember you sold 2?  Have a great
Camp...I wish I could have come...perhaps next year....Herb
