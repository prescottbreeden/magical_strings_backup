Hi, Philip. Just wanted to let you know that I met up with Mike Saunders
last week and saw a swatch of the purple fabric he can order for the harp
cases.  I sent a photo to Donna, and both of us love it, so we shall have
our purple cases :)

Just wanted to check in with you on when you think my harp may be ready, as
I would love to set up a lesson, and if the harp is still a few weeks out,
I would rather not wait to set up time for a lesson with you. And then I
would like to schedule regular lessons :)

By the way, I went to my first harp circle yesterday (in Tumwater) and had
a wonderful time playing with other harpers.  We really need to have a harp
circle in Gig Harbor or - Ollala ;)

Cheers,
Joyce
