Hi!!

Let’s definitely get started.  I’d love to have it all finished when you
get back from Ireland because I take off again for pretty much the exact
same tour schedule this year as I had last year.  That way there is no
stress and everything is printed and delivered to you well in advance of
you needing it.

I’ll lay out a general poster with the information that I have from years
past and the schedule that I have from Philip.  We can further refine from
there.

Hope your travels to the east coast were wonderful and…. IRELAND!  gah. 
What a beautiful time to go there and spend a few weeks.

lots of love,
c

Yuletide promo is around the corner and thought I'd start a conversation
about it now since you are busy with so many wonderful things.
