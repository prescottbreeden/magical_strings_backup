Hi there. I am inquiring about harp lessons. I took lessons quite a long
time ago from a women in grapeview but she moved away. I haven't touched
one since so very much a beginner. I have always been drawn to the Harp so
it seems fate has aligned for me as I work at Olalla elementary several
days a week.

Please email back or call with info about schedule and cost.

Blessings,
Michele Mayer
