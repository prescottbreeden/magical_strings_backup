Comment Philip,

Thank you for the talk this afternoon. I asked my daughters instructor
about which harp to look for. She recommended a troubadour? Not even sure
what a troubadour is, model or manufacturer. Do you build harps that
compare? Sorry I am complete novice when it comes to the harp.

Thank you

Vito DeSantis

soon. Don't forget.
