Hi Philip...I wanted to see if you have any time in your busy schedule for
a visit from us...Time seems to fly and before we know it Yuletide sneaks
up on Art Festival and that in turn closes in on Celtic Yuletide...all
this whether  we are having fun or not!
I'm languishing from empty shop syndrome and am perilously close to
starting another boat!  I wanted to talk to you about building a hammered
dulcimer...I do have some plans...I think the resulting instrument would
be very heavy...I also wanted a few dampers on my lap harp...although that
isn't by any means urgent..
We have an open week this week..we had guests for the past 11 days..and
Nikki hasn't any work ...I wanted to catch you before you go east...
We appreciate the photo you sent and the note from Pam...we have it beside
the prior years picture and with the family picture on the poster.
Don't feel any pressure to work us into your schedule I know you are a
busy man!  Any time we spend with you is a gift to us...I thought I'd send
out a "feeler"...
Take Care..Herb
