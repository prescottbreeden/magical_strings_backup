Hello Philip,
 
Are we still on for a dulcimer lesson today? I have it on my calendar for
2 p.m. instead of 1:30; was that a mistake on my part?

I should warn you that I've been having a lot of hay fever problems
recently (due to an abundance of grass pollen in Lakewood), so the amount
of practicing I've recently gotten in has been less than what I've wanted
to do (even with an anti-histamine "onboard", both Jeanne and I have been
miserable these last couple of weeks). Other than that, the biggest
problem that I've had during your tour is that I've forgotten the
transition between parts A and B of the Swallowtail Jig.
