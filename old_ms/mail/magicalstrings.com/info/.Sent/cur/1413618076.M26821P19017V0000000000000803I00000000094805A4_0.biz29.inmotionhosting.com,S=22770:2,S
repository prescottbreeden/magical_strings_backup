Hi Phillip

I was practicing a few days ago, and the low A string just snapped.  I
‘m sure it won’t affect the lesson on Tuesday night, but wondered if
you would be able to replace it after class?   If that doesn’t work, let
me know what day would work for you.

Thanks!


Carolyn

Hi Phillip

June 30th is fine.   I'm flexible on the time, maybe afternoon works better
for you, as you are just returning home.

Let me know the time, and I'll be there.

Have a great time on the cruise.   I'm jealous!

Bon Voyage

Hi Carolyn,

So sorry for this delay-- June 30 actually works best for me-- we're
preparing for the Celtic Cruise Alaska, leaving Friday morning, back by June
29.  Let's confirm time and day!

Take care,

Hi Phillip

I have a few dates that work for me for our lesson.  June 9th, 13th, 30, or
any day in July except Thursdays, July 2nd,  or the 4th of course.

I know you have the cruise in June, so if I don't see you before, have a
great time!  It sounds like a lot of fun.

Looking forward to our lesson.

All the best

Thanks Carolyn!

I think you'll be very happy with the  maple harp you have-- good choice!
Here are some of my ideas about payments:  we could do the payment plan you
propose, but would need to add a 5% processing fee (totaling $65) to cover
the monthly deposits and adjustments to the invoice; and should a check
accidentally bounce (heaven forbid) we would have to charge the penalties
for that... here's another idea I would propose:  I would offer you a 10%
discount on the harp itself (not the case, because my markup is so low as is
on harp cases) which amounts to $110 discount for you, if you would be
willing to pay for the harp in full using a credit card (or combination of
card and cash) when you come to class tonight.  Your total balance due in
that case would be $1,205.46 (after crediting your deposit).  Let me know
what you think-- my secretary is here now, and will start writing up the
invoice as soon as I hear back from you.

All my best,
Philip

Good Morning Phillip

Happy belated St. Patrick's Day!

I've made my decision regarding harp choice, and I would like to go with
maple. The first time we came to your studio, my husband asked if you would
consider accepting payments and that you may be open to working something
out with us.  I want to run this by you before I talk to my husband to see
if it works for you first.

I could pay $523.20 cash and with the $80.00 deposit it totals $603.20.
Give you six post dated checks for $133.33 to equal $800.00, and I believe
that would be the total of $1403.20 owing. for harp, case and taxes.  ( I
would like to have  F & C sharping levers added after the harp is paid for).

I have just found out about a financial educational  VA benefit for spouses
of disabled veterans, and I am in the process of applying for that,
regarding the certified clinical musician course, and if approved, I would
pay you in full.

If this works for you, or if you have other ideas, please let me know so I
can approach my husband, and hopefully have an answer for you tonight.

Thanks Phillip, see you tonight!
Carolyn

Hi Carolyn,

I strung the Midsize harp yesterday, it sounds great, and is ready for you
to come try it out any time.  I'll be here all day today and tomorrow, Weds
morning, and Thursday.  I'm leaving on Friday to go out of town then, back
by Feb 4.  Can you come this week sometime?

Hi Phillip

  I've decided to wait until you get the 4 octave harp built before I drive
over to meet you, and see the harps.  Please let me know when you are ready.

I'm counting down the days until harp lessons begin, I feel like a kid
waiting for Christmas!

See you soon.

Re: Your Magical Strings class registration<BR><BR>Hi Phillip<BR><BR>&nbsp; I've 
decided to wait until you get the 4 octave harp built before I drive<BR>over to 
meet you, and see the harps.&nbsp; Please let me know when you are 
ready.<BR><BR>I'm counting down the days until harp lessons begin, I feel like a 
kid<BR>waiting for Christmas!<BR><BR>See you 
soon.<BR><BR>Carolyn<BR><BR><BR>-----Original Message-----<BR>From: <A
