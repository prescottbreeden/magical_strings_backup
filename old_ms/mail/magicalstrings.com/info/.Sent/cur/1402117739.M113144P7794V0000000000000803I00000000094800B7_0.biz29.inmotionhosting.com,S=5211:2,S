Dear Friends of Justin and Monique,
We invite you to join Magical Strings this Saturday night, June 7, at
Traditions Cafe for a concert with Celtic music on harps, hammered
dulcimers, penny whistles, concertina and accordion. Traditions serves
wonderful food; there will be time for good conversation and shopping for
treasures from around the world. Reservations are suggested as our last
performance there was sold out.  Call 360-705-2819 or visit Traditions
online

or
just come to the door at 300 5th Ave SW in Olympia tomorrow night. Arrive
early for a delicious supper and a good seat. Concert starts at 8pm.

We will be playing special music for Justin, Monique and Asha in their home
town and sending energy out into the universe that they be allowed to
return SOON. We'll have a card there for friends to sign and perhaps we can
select something special for Asha.

Hope to see you tomorrow night in Olympia if you are in the area.  If you
are too far away, please continue to send loving prayers for their family
and call upon the powers that be to aid in their speedy return home to all
of us.

My very best,
Pam Boulding of
Magical Strings.


Just in case you have never heard of Magical Strings here is a little
something about us.

"*With dancing hammers and pulsating strings, Philip and Pam Boulding
together create the distinctive music of Magical Strings, described by The
Washington Post as "warm, graceful and sonically gorgeous." Celtic harps
and hammered dulcimers are colorfully augmented by pennywhistles,
concertina, accordion and storytelling. Since 1978 they have drawn a loyal
following worldwide, captivated by their energetic arrangements of Celtic
music and their own engaging compositions, intertwining Celtic roots with
classical and world music influences.*



*Practically a household name in the Northwest, Magical Strings for over 35
years has toured throughout the United States, Canada, Ireland and Japan,
and had the opportunity to tour 30 US cities as an opening act and then
record with the late Dan Fogelberg. Philip and Pam have recorded 20 of
their own albums on four labels with their most recent CD’s being released
on their own Magic Hill Music label: Longing for Ireland—Celebrating 35
Years; Best of Magical Strings—Dances and Dreams,  a 2-CD set; and Celtic
Yuletide Live, capturing their whole family in concert.  *


*Magical Strings has performed on media networks around the country,
including ‘A Prairie Home Companion,’ NPR's Weekend Edition, CNN both at
home and in Europe, prime time TV in Japan, Performance Today world wide
and can often be heard on Classic King FM. They placed first at Ireland’s
Grannard Bicentennial Harp Competition, and have collaborated with
Northwest ballet and theater companies.*



*The Bouldings run the School of Magical Strings, design and build
instruments for an international clientele  and continue to host the annual
Magic Hill Summer Harp Camp on their beautiful five acre farm overlooking
the Puget Sound. Philip and Pam love to share their music with children and
have performed and taught in schools throughout the country. Their love of
music is embraced by all five of their grown children and now their six
grandchildren, who dance and perform with them at their annual Celtic
Yuletide Concerts performed throughout the Northwest region." *
