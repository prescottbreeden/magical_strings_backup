Hello Philip,

I've been rather busy these past two weeks, but I have been able to do
some practicing, especially on Swallowtail Jig, and I was wondering if it
might be possible for another lesson next Wednesday afternoon (tomorrow is
lost due to the Memorial Day holiday messing up my physical therapy
schedule). I won't have any classes next Wednesday, so my schedule is
entirely open that day.
