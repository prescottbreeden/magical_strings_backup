Hi Philip....We wanted you to know how delighted we are to welcome you
this weekend!  We are happy our pad worked out for you during the Scottish
Games here in Mount Vernon. Will you be coming on Thursday evening or on
Friday? I remember we talked something about that... it would get you to
the Festival somewhat more refreshed!  You are of course welcome any time!
I wondered if you could bring the levers for my lap harp... And show me
how to install them? We have talked about it the past couple years but it
slips in and out of my mind...!
I purchased a set of strings for my large harp a year or so ago and I have
a replacement for the one that popped (I think) A large wound string let
go too..."D" I have one of those too!
The boat is finished and gone from my shop. I do have another half built
in Nikki's Mom's basement and I have plans for yet another but I would
like to try to build a lap harp....so I have some questions for you when
you are here if you'd be willing to share some information....and I swear
I won't compete with you for 29 years.... That would make me about 113 and
I probably wouldn't know a saw from a flat tire by then!
Please let us know if there is anything we can prepare in advance of your
coming that would be helpful to you...
We send our Love and best wishes as always...... Herb & Nikki
