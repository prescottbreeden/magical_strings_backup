Hi Dearest Brittany--
I thought you would enjoy this response from a fan to our last email
newsletter!  Our tour is going well== already missing home-- look forward
to seeing again!
Love,
Daddy


Hi Pam and Phil,

We have season tickets for NW Sinfonietta and are so excited  to hear
Brittany.  When I attended one of your Tacoma concerts EARLY ON (that is
a synonym for  many years ago !!!) Brittany was in a cradle on the stage.


When you perform at Traditions in Olympia, will you have your step-dancing
granddaughter with you? Or some of the Rainy Sisters perhaps?  We
couldn't find anything about the sisters on the computer or on your
website.

Thank you for any clues and answers you have.  I would love to attend
your concert at the Quaker Mtg House.  If only I lived there.!

Dear Friends,

Our Spring tour is going well with great concerts thus far in New
Hampshire, Sturbridge, MA and Maine. Presently we're spending a wonderful
few days with our granddaughters and family in Rhode Island before our
next two special concerts this weekend in Warwick and Cape Cod.

 

Updated concert information: 

Warwick, RI - Friday, April 25, 7:30 PM - Central Baptist Church, 3270
Post Road, 401-739-2828. You'll get a chance to see some family members in
concert with us at this acoustically beautiful old church.

Cape Cod, MA - Sunday, April 27, 5:00 pm - East Sandwich Quaker Meeting
House, 6 Quaker Road, in East Sandwich, MA, 508-259-8508 or
lewismranda@gmail.com. This is a very special event organized by Lewis
Randa, founder of the Peace Abbey which for many years was a treasured
stop of our spring tour. It will be a Magical Strings concert in tribute
to Elise Boulding, Philip's mother, peace activist and educator who had
close ties to the Peace Abbey in her later years. A Courage of Conscience
award will be presented at this concert which is taking place at the
oldest Quaker Meeting House in the country! For information and
reservations click here .
