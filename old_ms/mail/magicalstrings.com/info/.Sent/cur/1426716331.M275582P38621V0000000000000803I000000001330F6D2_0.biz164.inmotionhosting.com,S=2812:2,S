Celebrated St. Patricks Day with my mom who lives at Franke Tobey Jones
last night and heard that you will be there today. I will be on my way to
Portland, but my wife Debbye and mother Phyllis will be at your
performance and hope to meet you. If you had a spare tuning key we could
get for that harp that would be grand. It is okay if that doesn&#39;t work
out today.

     Hi Scott,

     &#160;

     Sorry I didn’t see your message in time before the concert! I can
send you a tuning key, or you can pick one up at Ted Brown music-
same size as they would use for autoharps.

     I’ll be back on Weds. To answer more questions, and see ab out
scheduling a lesson.

     My best,

     Philip

HI,


Last year my wife bought me a wire harp made by Philip at the Etta Project
charity auction. It came with a certificate for a free lesson that I would
like to redeem sometime. I didn&#39;t get a tuning key with it. Would you
know of a place locally I might buy one? The music stores like Ted Brown,
Guitar Center don&#39;t have them. I would buy one from you if you have an
extra. I live near Mason Church so if you get this message I could pick it
up before or after your concert here tonight.&#160;


Please call if you get this message, 253-222-1984
