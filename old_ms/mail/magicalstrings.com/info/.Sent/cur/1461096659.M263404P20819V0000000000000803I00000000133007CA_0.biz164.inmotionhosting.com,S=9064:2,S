     Hello Sandra,



     Thanks for sending.



     Re: the W9, I think we'll be paying to the business name, as we've
     done in the past. Therefore, please use "Magical Strings" on the
     Name line, and the TIN (Emp ID #) in Part 1, and resend to me.
     Please let me know if you have any questions.



     Thanks!

     Judy

         Judy, see W-9 at
             bottom of e-mail string. Perhaps Suzanne Amos already
             forwarded this.
