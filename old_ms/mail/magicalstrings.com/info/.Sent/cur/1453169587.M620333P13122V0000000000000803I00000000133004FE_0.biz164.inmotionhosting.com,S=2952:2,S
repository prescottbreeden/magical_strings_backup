Thank you for your help. I'm really pleased with the harp. The string
range is just what I was looking for.

>The 9th string, G, requires a .032. I only have a .036 in clear. Can I
use that, or will I have trouble getting it in tune? If that won't work,
any suggestions on where to buy strings? These are from when I had a
Harpsicle. I did use them on the Dusty Strings I had. But I've never
tried using the wrong size string. (I also don't have the .028)
