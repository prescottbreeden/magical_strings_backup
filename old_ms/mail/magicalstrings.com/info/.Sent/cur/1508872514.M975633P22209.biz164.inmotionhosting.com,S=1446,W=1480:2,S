Hi Philip.....Happy Sunshine! I suspect it is beautiful around your home
this time of year..Of course It is beautiful any time of year!  We had a
good trip to Nova Scotia...the weather was superb!  You are doubtless
gearing up for the concert season...
I am replacing my “chop saw” It is an older Craftsman miter saw...I think
it has a 10” blade...there is nothing wrong with it...If you have any need
of one I’ll give it to you...I though I’d check with you first!
I hope you both are well...we look forward to seeing you on the 10th of
December!
Take Care...Herb
