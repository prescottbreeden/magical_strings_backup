Good to hear back from you. My fault for not sending that message earlier
in the week. It is helpful to know that the tuning key would be the same
as used on autoharps. I would think Ted Brown should have that. I will be
in Portland on Wednesday but maybe we can touch base on Thursday or Friday
to set a time. I will be gone after that until the 28th.&#160;

     Hi Scott,

     &#160;

     Sorry I didn’t see your message in time before the concert! I can
send you a tuning key, or you can pick one up at Ted Brown music-
same size as they would use for autoharps.

     I’ll be back on Weds. To answer more questions, and see ab out
scheduling a lesson.

     My best,

     Philip

HI,


Last year my wife bought me a wire harp made by Philip at the Etta Project
charity auction. It came with a certificate for a free lesson that I would
like to redeem sometime. I didn&#39;t get a tuning key with it. Would you
know of a place locally I might buy one? The music stores like Ted Brown,
Guitar Center don&#39;t have them. I would buy one from you if you have an
extra. I live near Mason Church so if you get this message I could pick it
up before or after your concert here tonight.&#160;


Please call if you get this message, 253-222-1984
