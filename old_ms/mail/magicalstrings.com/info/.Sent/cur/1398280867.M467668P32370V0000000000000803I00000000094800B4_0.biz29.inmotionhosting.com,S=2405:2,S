Comment I see the cruise trip. that should be a great opportunity for you and the passangers. Just wondered if you were thinking of coming to San diego? I just talked to Scott Cossu and he is thinking of coming down and doing a concert tour in Santa Barbara, LA and San Diego. Could be an interesting Double Bill? Maybe or not. Just a thought. Hope all is well in the NW for you. One place you might check out id dizzysjazz.com. as a possible venue.
Sincerely,
Tom Wilson
