Hi Phillip,
Sorry I missed your call.
These are my questions:
Height & width of mid size OLADION
Is the sound similar to the example on the web site
Is there a shoulder strap or how does one hold the harp on lap
Does the harp stand alone without another type of stand
Is the cherry wood a stain put on the maple
How far apart are the strings

Correctly I play a cherrywood harpsicle with 26 strings that are 1/2" apart.
I tried a harp similar to yours and the strings were just slightly more
than 1/2" apart and my fingers didn't hit two strings at the same time.
I have only been playing the harp for a year, and only for my enjoyment
but, I really like the richer fuller sound of the harps with the shape of
the Oladion.

Will I hear a fuller sound than with the Oladion than I hear with the
harpsicle?

I will try to call you around 10/11 tomorrow, but if you wish you can
respond to this email with the answers.

Thank you,
Judy
