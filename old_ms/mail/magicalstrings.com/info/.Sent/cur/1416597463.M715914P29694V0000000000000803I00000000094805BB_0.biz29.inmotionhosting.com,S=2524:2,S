Hi Philip and Pam. Just checking with you again to see if you might be
heading
our way any time soon. We are located in the small town of Yreka,
California and
would love to have you guys in for a concert. We seat 50 and the venue is
warm
and inviting. We are just off of I-5 so it's a perfect stop on your way
down or
back home.

Hope we can connect someday soon.
