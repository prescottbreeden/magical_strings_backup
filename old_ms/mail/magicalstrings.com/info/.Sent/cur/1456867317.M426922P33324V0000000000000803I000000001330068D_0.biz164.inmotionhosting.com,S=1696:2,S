Dear Philip my Friend...Don't give it a thought nor an apology...If you
get an hour before you head east that will be great and if you don't it
simply means that I will have additional time for pleasant expectation! 
We are going to Arizona next week for about a week...
I'm glad you have a lot of orders. I wish I lived closer to you I could do
some mundane things like sweep and sand or hand rub some finish...
A couple people showed great interest in the harp at our Christmas open
house...perhaps it will lead to a couple sales at Anacortes! I'll alert
them when we get close to the festival...
If you were able to use the band saw...I found a couple new blades..I
don't know what size you need..but these won't fit my current saw....quite
possibly they fit yours.
Say hello to Pam for us...
Take Care...Herb
