Hi my Friend...We are sorry for your loss...suicide is a doubly hard loss
and it raises all manner of questions which don't have to be faced when
death comes by natural means!
I know you are busy and I don't want you to give it another thought!  We
have both been under the weather..we went to AZ on March 8 I got the flu
on the 9th and Nikki the next day...mine morphed into pneumonia and
Nikki's to bronchitis and sinusitis...we are slowly getting better... but
we still lack enough energy to do much...
I can't imagine what ails Anacortes...you'd think they would reserve a
spot for regulars...maybe I should speak to the mayor or someone
important. We have several people who wanted to meet you here who
expressed great interest in owning and playing a harp...two of my
neighbors and a person from Bellingham...perhaps we can arrange a meeting
anyway. We would certainly miss you if you didn't come for your annual
visit...
Have a great Spring Tour, travel safely and come back refreshed and
inspired...
Take Care, Herb
