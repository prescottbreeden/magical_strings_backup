I have a harp that my nephew made and I’d like to show it to you and see
what you think. Is there a convenient time I can meet with you at the
Capital Hill location?  I plan to take your harp lessons this Oct
(probably rent a harp).  I have no musical background.  One sister plays a
piano but all I play is kitchen melodies in a dishpan.

Thanks.
