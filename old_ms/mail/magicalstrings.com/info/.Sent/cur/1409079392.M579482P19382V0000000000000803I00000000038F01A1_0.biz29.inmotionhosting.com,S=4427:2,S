Hello Philip & Pam,

I have such good memories of your concert in Newport News last spring... and
a few CD's. So lovely; especially the originals.

I am writing to let you know that we have planned an alumni concert
fundraiser as Virginia Children's Chorus' main event this coming May, and so
will not be able to have a Magical Strings concert as well. Too many irons
in the fire!

I am keeping all of our correspondance though, and hope one year we will
make it happen. It would be so great to collaborate with you two!

Peace & best wishes,
Carol
