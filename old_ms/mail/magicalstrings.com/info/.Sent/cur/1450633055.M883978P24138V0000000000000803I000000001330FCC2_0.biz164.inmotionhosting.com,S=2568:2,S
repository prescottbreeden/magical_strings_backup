Comment Hello Phil,

I would like to find the strings for a lovely little hammered dulcimer
from Magical Strings, circa October 1988 -SD 233

I bought the dulcimer for my husband, Allan, several years ago now. He had
to delay his retirement and learning to play, but now he's eager to try
again.

The hope was  to find out before Christmas whether only the broken string,
or all the strings need replacing, and to have them for Allan by Christmas
morning. After searching web articles, I still don't know what is needed,
though it sounds like proper string gauge is very important, and must be
learned from the dulcimer's maker. Which is why I'm writing you now.

I realize this is most certainly not the time of year when you are likely
to have time to spare to help me get the dulcimer string or strings
replaced. But might you have a moment to tell me the proper string gauge
and perhaps direct me to a source? Perhaps even someone who might help me
get the dulcimer strung in time for Xmas --though I realize the latter is
probably out of the question at this late date.

Thank you, Phil, for reading this far with your busy schedule this time of
year. I will be most grateful for whatever you might suggest. Even just
having the string(s) for Allan would be nice on Xmas morning.  Merry
Christmas to you and yours, and the Happiest of New Years! --Jeanne Vogel

Jeanne Vogel has been sent an email telling them you will be in touch
soon. Don't forget.

Love from your website form.
