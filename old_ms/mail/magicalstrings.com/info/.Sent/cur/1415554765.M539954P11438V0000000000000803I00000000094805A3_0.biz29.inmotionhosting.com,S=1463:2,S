Hi Philip....Greetings from Up State NY....I'm visiting my brother for a
few days to celebrate our birthdays though it doesn't happen until the end
of the month.  I'm happy you had a great trip in Ireland....was it the
inspiration for some lovely music?
I am very well considering my recent escapade heart wise...I'm not quite
robust but I'm doing remarkably well...We look forward to your Mount
Vernon concert...I suspect you are busy with preparations.
We hope all is well with you and yours....give our love to Pam..
Take Care, Herb
