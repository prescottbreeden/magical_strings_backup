Hi Philip....We are wondering if you have heard anything from Anacortes
Art Festival and/or if you are attending the Scottish Games in Mount
Vernon...
There are several people interested in harps.  My neighbor, Leila whom you
have met currently has my lap harp. I am attempting to keep her interest
keen...her husband is ready to buy! There are others who have shown
interest...including a lady from Bellingham and another neighbor
here...when you know your schedule perhaps we could arrange a meeting with
them...a couple are interested in Harp Camp!
Did you have a good eastern tour?
I still would like to talk dulcimers when you get a chance... if you get
to Anacortes  or Mount Vernon we can have a chat then.
We hope you are both well and that we will see you soon!
Take Care, Herb
