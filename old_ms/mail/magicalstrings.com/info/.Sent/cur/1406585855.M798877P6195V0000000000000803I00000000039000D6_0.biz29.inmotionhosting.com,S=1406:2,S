Hi Philip, I’m interested in selling my harp.  I have had it long enough
to know that I probably will not ever spend the hours it would take to be
an accomplished player.  You mentioned you are no longer making this
model, so I thought you might know of someone who wants one.

I paid $1,500.00 for the harp and case, and I added pedals to it as you
know.  I have an electrical tuner, music and other parts.  I would be
willing to sell it for $1,500.00.

Thanks for thinking about this.
