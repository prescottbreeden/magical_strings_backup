Hi Philip,

One of my little dancer's mom is looking for a hammered dulcimer teacher
for her.  Adele is 8 and darling.  Below are the two teachers listed on the
Dusty Strings website, and I am wondering if you know anything about them.

Or, this would be a great opportunity for one of your intermediate students
as she is young and just starting out.

And she has a little brother, Ze Hua, that they want to learn an instrument
as well - maybe bodhran.

Thank for any help!

Sara

These are the two teachers listed on the Dusty Strings web page.  I have
not contacted them to check on availability, other teachers, where they
teach or anything.  I wanted to run the names by you first and see if you
had others to recommend.  If they could also teach Ze Hua (maybe bodhran or
whistle or even piano) that would be a bonus!

Thanks for considering this.
