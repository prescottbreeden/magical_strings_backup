Hi Philip-
Thanks for the info!
We're still in Eugene, though at a different house than you stayed at (that
was 2 houses and another child ago.) Be well and stop by if you're in the
'hood.
Best,
Mary

Sorry for this long delay!  After our recent return from Ireland we were<br>
madly catching up on deadlines.  Of course I remember you well, and my stay<br>
at your place... good Lord, I can&#39;t believe that little baby girl is in<br>
college now!  Back to your question:<br>
<br>
The wire harp is built a little heavier to withstand more tension; you can<br>
change it out to nylon, but will sound a bit plunky, that&#39;s all.  I&#39;ve<br>
attached a string chart so you can see the gauges I use.  I still start with<br>
c below middle c, though you&#39;ll find the tension over-all lower than you are<br>
accustomed to.<br>
<br>
Let me know if I can help further-- you still in Portland area?<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>

Comment Hi Phil! It&#39;s been quite some time since we&#39;ve met. I hope you&#39;re<br>
well. I don&#39;t know if you remember my little blonde baby (and her brother<br>
who wasn&#39;t born yet when you stayed with us) but she just left for college.<br>
I&#39;ve had frozen shoulder in one and then the other shoulder for years, so<br>
still am not performing, but still love to teach. Someone gave me a Boulding<br>
lap harp, a wire strung, and I&#39;m wondering if I can change out the strings<br>
to nylon. The gal at Markwood Strings says I need the vibrating length for<br>
each string so she can determine whether that will work and what note to<br>
start on, but I thought I&#39;d just check with you. Ideas? Be well!<br>
<br>
Mary DeMocker has been sent an email telling them you will be in touch soon.<br>
