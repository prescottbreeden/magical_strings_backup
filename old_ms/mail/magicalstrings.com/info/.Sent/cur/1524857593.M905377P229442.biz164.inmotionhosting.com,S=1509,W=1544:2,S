Hi Lois - My name is Sandra Lewis and I work in the office of Magical
Strings. I was just talking with Pam. She and Philip are currently on tour
on the east coast and I am here in the office occasionally to check
messages. Pam asked me to contact you about details for their Tall Timbers
Concert scheduled for May 11. Can you let us know what time it is
scheduled to start, the address for the venue, and also the performance
fee for Philip and Pam. Is there anything you need from Magical Strings to
help promote the concert? I checked the events on the Tall Timbers fb page
but didn't see it listed. Once we have more details from you we'll post
the event on the Magical Strings facebook page as well. We look forward to
hearing from you.

Sandra
