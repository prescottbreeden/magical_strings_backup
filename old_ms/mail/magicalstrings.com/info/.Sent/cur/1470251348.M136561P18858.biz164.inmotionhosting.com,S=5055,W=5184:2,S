well i made it home safely and went right to sleep, exhausted from a full
weekend of fun.
i just wanted to thank you Philip for giving some lessons and workshops on
topics that were really helpful for me.
i think the other intermediates there really enjoyed them too.

i'll ping you later this year about the idea of some private lessons,
and hopefully Laurie will be able to join me.
till then, take care, wishing you and Pam and the family continues success
with all the work you're doing,
and so happy we got to spend time together this past weekend.
i've really missed listening to you play.

if you do turn out a new CD this year, PLEASE let me know.
i've played the rest of your stuff to death.

-dave
