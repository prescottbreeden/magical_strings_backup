Dear Matt,
This is Sandra, replying from a remote location (my house) since Philip
and Pam have no power yet today. Philip asked me to let you know that he
will get back to you as soon as he can with answers to your questions. He
did want me to ask you if you would be available and would like to join
them for a rehearsal this Saturday (the 21st) at Brenin's house at 3:00
pm. Philip is expecting the power to be back on by mid to late afternoon
today. Pam's cell phone number is 253-691-6287 if you want to talk to
them. You can also likely get an email to Philip via
philtheharper@gmail.com

Sandra
for Philip and Pam
