Hi Philip,

I hope you are doing well and had a lovely summer.  I've been roughly
maintaining my harp skills, and I'd like to take lessons this fall,
but I don't know if I should sign up for the beginner or intermediate.

Also, the Feisty harp decided to break two neighboring strings.  I
don't know why it keeps doing this...I've noticed that they like to
break in the evening.  They never break while I'm playing.  Weird!


I'm going to be down the street from you at the end of the week (not
sure exactly when, as it depends on Gary Jackson's schedule), so I was
wondering if you have any availability to fix the feisty harp on
Friday?

Perhaps we could briefly go over what I can still do and you could
make an assessment for my class level then.

If I'm in between ...how much do private harp lessons cost?

Thank you and take care,

Melissa Burns
