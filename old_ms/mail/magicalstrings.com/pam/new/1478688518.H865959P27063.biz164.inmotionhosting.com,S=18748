His name is Tom Ericson, a home-scientist who decided it was time to stop wasting old batteries
<http://upword.ccbgg.stream/Lsbfxgbmq/radautmgw1357fdnyr/cyLreaUcnfhbb1fa6wvJeb47HizGWTZpxmoQD2coOp4/n9jzQOeXmYwaQBS1zF_fvXahwTPQLIHXNOVMbwnqhDY0xU928w2ZKuuqZyPNJ8n_1RkWjRkhR20YRn90Zw7tTFHldOayEavGOyzvMFothSU>.

""I'm not a rich man, and batteries aren&#39;t cheap,&quot; said Ericson when he was asked what prompted this &quot;discovery&quot; of his. According to Ericson, few people know how easy it can be to restore old batteries
<http://upword.ccbgg.stream/Lsbfxgbmq/radautmgw1357fdnyr/cyLreaUcnfhbb1fa6wvJeb47HizGWTZpxmoQD2coOp4/n9jzQOeXmYwaQBS1zF_fvXahwTPQLIHXNOVMbwnqhDY0xU928w2ZKuuqZyPNJ8n_1RkWjRkhR20YRn90Zw7tTFHldOayEavGOyzvMFothSU> if you have the tools, which can easily be purchased at local hardware stores or at websites like amazon.com and others.

The process involves just a little bit of prep work and then a handful of steps to clean and sometimes recharge the batteries a bit, all of which can easily be done at home at a far lower cost
<http://upword.ccbgg.stream/Lsbfxgbmq/radautmgw1357fdnyr/cyLreaUcnfhbb1fa6wvJeb47HizGWTZpxmoQD2coOp4/n9jzQOeXmYwaQBS1zF_fvXahwTPQLIHXNOVMbwnqhDY0xU928w2ZKuuqZyPNJ8n_1RkWjRkhR20YRn90Zw7tTFHldOayEavGOyzvMFothSU> than constantly purchasing new batteries.

Ericson says the only reason most people don&#39;t know about this is &quot;because the energy companies and production companies aren&#39;t interested in getting the word out.&quot;
