<p style=3D"display:none;">Surrey =E3=80=80=E3=80=80The envelope was thick =
and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emer=
ald-green ink. There was no stamp. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Turning the envelope o=
ver, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms=
; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. =E3=
=80=80=E3=80=80"Hurry up, boy!" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. "Wha=
t are you doing, checking for letter bombs?" He chuckled at his own joke. =
=E3=80=80=E3=80=80Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his lett=
er. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly =
began to open the yellow envelope. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Uncle Vernon ripped op=
en the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. =E3=80=80=
=E3=80=80"Marge's ill," he informed Aunt Petunia. "Ate a funny whelk. --." =
=E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Dad!" said Dudley suddenly. "Dad, Harry's got something!=
" =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which w=
as written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked =
sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"That's mine!" s=
aid Harry, trying to snatch it back. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Who'd be writing to=
 you?" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glan=
cing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic li=
ghts. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of =
old porridge. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"P-P-Petunia!" he gasped. =E3=80=80=E3=80=
=80Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it hig=
h out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line.=
 For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat =
and made a choking noise. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vern=
on!" =E3=80=80=E3=80=80They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten=
 that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being =
ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick=
=2E =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"I want to read that letter," he said loudly. want to=
 read it," said Harry furiously, "as it's mine." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Get out=
, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its e=
nvelope. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Harry didn't move. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80I WANT MY L=
ETTER!" he shouted. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Let me see it!" demanded Dudley. =E3=
=80=80=E3=80=80"OUT!" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudle=
y by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the =
kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silen=
t fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his gla=
sses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack =
between door and floor. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Vernon," Aunt Petunia was saying=
 in a quivering voice, "look at the address -- how could they possibly know=
 where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house?" =E3=80=80=E3=
=80=80"Watching -- spying -- might be following us," muttered Uncle Vernon =
wildly. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write b=
ack? Tell them we don't want --" =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Harry could see Uncle Ve=
rnon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80=
"No," he said finally. "No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer...=
 Yes, that's best... we won't do anything.... =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"But --" =
=E3=80=80=E3=80=80"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swea=
r when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?" =E3=80=80=E3=
=80=80That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something h=
e'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80=
"Where's my letter?" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed throu=
gh the door. "Who's writing to me?" =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"No one. it was addre=
ssed to you by mistake," said Uncle Vernon shortly. "I have burned it." =E3=
=80=80=E3=80=80"It was not a mistake," said Harry angrily, "it had my cupbo=
ard on it." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"SILENCE!" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple =
of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then force=
d his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Er =
-- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking...=
 you're really getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you=
 moved into Dudley's second bedroom. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Why?" said Harry. =
=E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Don't ask questions!" snapped his uncle. "Take this stuf=
f upstairs, now." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: =
one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vern=
on's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all =
the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took =
Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to th=
is room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in=
 here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, w=
orking tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in th=
e corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot th=
rough when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdca=
ge, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a re=
al air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley =
had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things =
in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched. =E3=80=80=E3=
=80=80From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don=
't want him in there... I need that room... make him get out...." =E3=80=80=
=E3=80=80Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have giv=
en anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with t=
hat letter than up here without it. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Next morning at break=
fast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacke=
d his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his moth=
er, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn'=
t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitt=
erly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petu=
nia kept looking at each other darkly. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80When the mail arri=
ved, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley=
 go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all t=
he way down the hall. Then he shouted, "There's another one! 'Mr. H. Potter=
, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'" =E3=80=80=E3=80=80With a strang=
led cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry righ=
t behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the l=
etter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed=
 Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fight=
ing, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon st=
raightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand=
=2E =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom," he whe=
ezed at Harry. "Dudley -- go -- just go." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Harry walked ro=
und and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard a=
nd they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter. Surely that mea=
nt they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had =
a plan. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the =
next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't =
wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights=
=2E =E3=80=80=E3=80=80He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of=
 Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered=
 as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door -- =E3=80=80=E3=80=
=80Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on t=
he doormat -- something alive! =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Lights clicked on upstairs=
 and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been =
his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door=
 in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what h=
e'd been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then =
told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the=
 kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncl=
e Vernon's lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. =E3=
=80=80=E3=80=80I want --" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letter=
s into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He s=
tayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"See," he expl=
ained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, "if they can't deliver t=
hem they'll just give up." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"I'm not sure that'll work, Ve=
rnon." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Pe=
tunia, they're not like you and me," said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in =
a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. =E3=
=80=80=E3=80=80On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As=
 they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door=
, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window=
 in the downstairs bathroom. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Uncle Vernon stayed at home =
again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boa=
rded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. =
He hummed "Tiptoe Through the Tulips" as he worked, and jumped at small noi=
ses. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty=
-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden=
 inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had han=
ded Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made fu=
rious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someo=
ne to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.=
 =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?" Dudley a=
sked Harry in amazement. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon =
sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. =
=E3=80=80=E3=80=80"No post on Sundays," he reminded them cheerfully as he s=
pread marmalade on his newspapers, "no damn letters today --" =E3=80=80=E3=
=80=80Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caug=
ht him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letter=
s came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but =
Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Out! OUT!"=
 =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him=
 into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms ov=
er their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the let=
ters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. =E3=
=80=80=E3=80=80"That does it," said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly bu=
t pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all =
back here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some =
clothes. No arguments!" =E3=80=80=E3=80=80He looked so dangerous with half =
his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wr=
enched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding=
 toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had =
hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his telev=
ision, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80They drove. A=
nd they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going. Eve=
ry now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the oppos=
ite direction for a while. "Shake'em off... shake 'em off," he would mutter=
 whenever he did this. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80They didn't stop to eat or drink a=
ll day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in h=
is life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to=
 see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his comput=
er. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking=
 hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with =
twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sit=
ting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wond=
ering.... =E3=80=80=E3=80=80They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomat=
oes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the ow=
ner of the hotel came over to their table. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"'Scuse me, bu=
t is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred of these at the =
front desk." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80She held up a letter so they could read the =
green ink address:</p>
<div style=3D"display:none;">"The Potters, that's right, that's what I hear=
d yes, their son, Harry" =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear f=
looded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say somethi=
ng to them, but thought better of it. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80He dashed back acro=
ss the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to dist=
urb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home num=
ber when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his=
 mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusu=
al name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son =
called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was calle=
d Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold=
=2E There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at=
 any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister lik=
e that... but all the same, those people in cloaks... =E3=80=80=E3=80=80He =
found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he l=
eft the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked st=
raight into someone just outside the door. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Sorry," he gr=
unted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds b=
efore Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn=
't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary=
, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made=
 passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me =
today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourse=
lf should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!" =E3=80=80=E3=80=80And the=
 old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. =E3=80=80=E3=
=80=80Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complet=
e stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was.=
 He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was =
imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approv=
e of imagination. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80As he pulled into the driveway of numbe=
r four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the=
 tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall=
=2E He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its ey=
es. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move.=
 It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley w=
ondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He=
 was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. =E3=80=80=E3=80=
=80Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all ab=
out Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned =
a new word ("Won't!"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had b=
een put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last repo=
rt on the evening news: =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"And finally, bird-watchers every=
where have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusuall=
y today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in d=
aylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in eve=
ry direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have=
 suddenly changed their sleeping pattern." The newscaster allowed himself a=
 grin. "Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Go=
ing to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?" =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Well, =
Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not only the =
owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorks=
hire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I=
 promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps peop=
le have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, f=
olks! But I can promise a wet night tonight." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80 =E3=80=80=
=E3=80=80The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry re=
ad on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. "Oh, I see -- so you've never bee=
n to Brazil?" =E3=80=80=E3=80=80As the snake shook its head, a deafening sh=
out behind Harry made both of them jump. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"DUDLEY! MR. DUR=
SLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!" =E3=
=80=80=E3=80=80Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. =E3=80=
=80=E3=80=80"Out of the way, you," he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Cau=
ght by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happ=
ened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley wer=
e leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with h=
owls of horror. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front =
of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling i=
tself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile=
 house screamed and started running for the exits. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80As the=
 snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice s=
aid, "Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80The keepe=
r of the reptile house was in shock. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"But the glass," he =
kept saying, "where did the glass go?" =E3=80=80=E3=80=80The zoo director h=
imself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized ove=
r and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had s=
een, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as=
 it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudle=
y was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was sw=
earing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at=
 least, was Piers calming down enough to say, "Harry was talking to it, wer=
en't you, Harry?" =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was saf=
ely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could har=
dly speak. He managed to say, "Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals," before =
he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large =
brandy. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishin=
g he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure t=
he Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to =
the kitchen for some food. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80He'd lived with the Dursleys a=
lmost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever si=
nce he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn'=
t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he s=
trained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a str=
ange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his fo=
rehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where =
all the green light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His=
 aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to a=
sk questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. =E3=80=80=E3=
=80=80When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unkno=
wn relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursley=
s were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that stra=
ngers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, t=
oo. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping=
 with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the =
man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. =
A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once=
 on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his ha=
nd in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The wei=
rdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the se=
cond Harry tried to get a closer look. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80At school, Harry h=
ad no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in=
 his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree wit=
h Dudley's gang. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80CHAPTER THREE =E3=80=80=E3=80=80THE LETT=
ERS FROM NO ONE =E3=80=80=E3=80=80The escape of the Brazilian boa constrict=
or earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out=
 of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had alre=
ady broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, =
first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crosse=
d Privet Drive on her crutches. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Harry was glad school was=
 over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every=
 single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, bu=
t as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. Th=
e rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Har=
ry Hunting. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80This was why Harry spent as much time as poss=
ible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the h=
olidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he woul=
d be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he =
wouldn't be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old pri=
vate school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the ot=
her hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thou=
ght this was very funny. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"They stuff people's heads down =
the toilet the first day at Stonewall," he told Harry. "Want to come upstai=
rs and practice?" =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"No, thanks," said Harry. "The poor toi=
let's never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be si=
ck." Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said. =E3=80=80=E3=
=80=80One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smelti=
ngs uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as usua=
l. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and sh=
e didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch televisi=
on and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it =
for several years. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80That evening, Dudley paraded around th=
e living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore=
 maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boater=
s. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the =
teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later l=
ife. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Un=
cle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt P=
etunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudl=
eykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to s=
peak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not=
 to laugh. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the =
next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from =
a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of =
what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"What=
's this?" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if h=
e dared to ask a question. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Your new school uniform," she=
 said. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Harry looked in the bowl again. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80=
"Oh," he said, "I didn't realize it had to be so wet." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"D=
otA be stupid," snapped Aunt Petunia. "I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old thin=
gs gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished." =
=E3=80=80=E3=80=80Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to =
argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was goi=
ng to look on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits o=
f old elephant skin, probably. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Dudley and Uncle Vernon ca=
me in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new unifo=
rm. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelti=
ng stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80They=
 heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. =E3=
=80=80=E3=80=80"Get the mail, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon from behind his pa=
per. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Make Harry get it." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Get the mail=
, Harry." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Make Dudley get it." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80"Poke h=
im with your Smelting stick, Dudley." =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Harry dodged the Sm=
elting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a p=
ostcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle o=
f Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and -- a letter for Harr=
y. =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twangin=
g like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written t=
o him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong=
 to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Y=
et here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: =
=E3=80=80=E3=80=80Mr. H. Potter =E3=80=80=E3=80=80The Cupboard under the St=
airs =E3=80=80=E3=80=804 Privet Drive =E3=80=80=E3=80=80Little Whinging</di=
