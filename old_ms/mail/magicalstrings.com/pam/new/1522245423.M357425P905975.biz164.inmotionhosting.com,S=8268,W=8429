 Content preview:  Dear Friends, I’ve heard back from a few of you who have
    tried to order Twisted Oak from Amazon. The book is listed as “Temporarily
    Out of Stock” and those who have ordered as far back as February 2nd have
    not received their books yet. This is a Print on Demand book, so this shouldn’t
    be happening. Books should only take about a week to be printed and sent
   to you. [...]
