What fun it was to be (re) connect as a group! We very much enjoyed =
having you all join us in our home to get to know each other.

As promised, here's a link to FEMA about making an emergency plan.=20

https://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan

Here's a link to some good information about being prepared for specific =
types of emergencies:

https://www.ready.gov/be-informed

Note the sidebar on the right side of the page that lists many types of =
emergencies. The "earthquake" link and the "severe weather" link  are =
especially pertinent to our area.

I'll send additional preparedness links as I discover them. (Don't want =
to inundate you with too much information at one time.) (-:


Enjoy the rest of your weekend =96 I look forward to getting together =
again soon.

Cheers,
Charlee
