Notice of Data Breach

You may have heard reports recently about a security issue involving Linked=
In.  We would like to make sure you have the facts about what happened, wha=
t information was involved, and the steps we are taking to help protect you=
.

What Happened?

On May 17, 2016, we became aware that data stolen from LinkedIn in 2012 was=
 being made available online.  This was not a new security breach or hack. =
  We took immediate steps to invalidate the passwords of all LinkedIn accou=
nts that we believed might be at risk.  These were accounts created prior t=
o the 2012 breach that had not reset their passwords since that breach.

What Information Was Involved?

Member email addresses, hashed passwords, and LinkedIn member IDs (an inter=
nal identifier LinkedIn assigns to each member profile) from 2012.

What We Are Doing

We invalidated passwords of all LinkedIn accounts created prior to the 2012=
 breach that had not reset their passwords since that breach.  In addition,=
 we are using automated tools to attempt to identify and block any suspicio=
us activity that might occur on LinkedIn accounts. We are also actively eng=
aging with law enforcement authorities.

LinkedIn has taken significant steps to strengthen account security since 2=
012.  For example, we now use salted hashes to store passwords and enable a=
dditional account security by offering our members the option to use two-st=
ep verification.

What You Can Do

We have several dedicated teams working diligently to ensure that the infor=
mation members entrust to LinkedIn remains secure. While we do all we can, =
we always suggest that our members visit our Safety Center to learn about e=
nabling two-step verification, and implementing strong passwords in order t=
o keep their accounts as safe as possible.  We recommend that you regularly=
 change your LinkedIn password and if you use the same or similar passwords=
 on other online services, we recommend you set new passwords on those acco=
unts as well.

For More Information

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact our Trust & Safety t=
eam at tns-help@linkedin.com.  To learn more visit our official blog.
