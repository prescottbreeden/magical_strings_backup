Hello everyone,
Thank you for putting a schedule into place Bonnie and for your igniting =
sparks, Esther.

Bonnie and I had talked about the possibility of doing two soul calendar =
verses, the 30th week and the week after.
Please, have a look at them, the change of mood is so interestingly =
reflected by the forms and colors. Would you be up for it?

Thank you all,

Andrea
