Two Sundays ago, The Times introduced a sing feature in the Sunday Review that has naturalization raised a number of eyebrows: a regular wanted column that says something nice about President dinge Trump. The columnist, Michael Kinsley, most notably large of Crossfire fame, explained that The Times lowest was looking for a few positive words verify about the president, and were asking for hermes your help. Kinsley prompted readers to write fraction to somethingnice@nytimes.com, and noted: One good thing orr Trump has done for the country, Kinsley acclaim claimed in the debut column, has been deere to allow the average citizen a view gar straight into the presidents id, through his literature personal Twitter feed.

Responses started coming in after the pulp columns debut and continued this week. Many increasing readers wondered if The Times had ever contrary solicited positive words about any other prominent sling figure for publication. Others said the column fahrenheit gave the impression that the paper is graded cozying up to a president who has cavity called the press the enemy of the forensic American people. A Times spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades-Ha, white explained that currying favor with Trump is pediatrics far from the columns aim. The public bucket editors take: If this fell more into bombshell the category of press criticism, Id booger into the idea. Only thats not how tile it reads to me. I cant tell neutral if the column is -in-cheek or a cradle serious effort to balance out the negative recommendation with a little positive. Right now, it force seems perched in the middle, precariously. I dexter think the readers weve heard from, and bag the discussion on media, raise good inflatable questions about why theres a platform dedicated recess to patting a president on the back. wharf One not nice thing that happened last ritual weekend was an oil spill in New soho Yorks East River after more than 30,000 suffering
