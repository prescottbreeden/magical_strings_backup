Hello,

Well that&#39;s not true!

This formula is being called the miracel-hair growth-solution, because it REALLY works.

But intensely stressful situationsthink: life-threatening medical diagnosis, death of a loved onecan trigger hair loss even weeks after the initial event. (Check out this other surprisingly common cause of thinning hair.) This hair loss does not have to be permanent. Your hair can grow back if you learn to control your stress, according to theGuilty of using hot tools for sleek, shiny hair, or straightening chemicals or oils to tame your locks? Your hair might look good for the moment, but in the long run, you&#39;re damaging itand raising your risk of hair loss. The use of hair tools is a national epidemic, and all of these have very negative impacts on your hair, says Omeed Memar, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of clinical dermatology at Northwestern University&#39;s Feinberg School of Medicine. (Find out the only way to use heat on your hair safely.) Instead try to buy natural hair products: ones that don&#39;t list 40 scary chemical ingredients.
Any kind of physical trauma?surgery, a car accident, or a severe illness, even the flu?can cause temporary hair loss. This can trigger a type of hair loss called telogen effluvium. Hair has a programmed life cycle: a growth phase, rest phase and shedding phase. When you have a really stressful event, it can shock the hair cycle, (pushing) more hair into the shedding phase, explains Marc Glashofer, MD, a dermatologist in New York City. Hair loss often becomes noticeable three-to-six months after the trauma. Pregnancy is one example of the type of physical stress that can cause hair loss (that and hormones). Pregnancy-related hair loss is seen more commonly after your baby has been delivered rather than actually during pregnancy. Giving birth is pretty traumatic, says Dr. Glashofer. Everyone loses hair.
