Theres a part of 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone that would love to continue competing. After several months of debating it, she knew her place in her sport is now as a coach.Schiavone announced her retirement at age 38 during a news conference at the U.S. Open on Wednesday, saying she accomplished her two biggest goals as a player _ winning a title at Roland Garros and being ranked in the top 10 _ and now wants to try to help someone else become good enough to earn a Grand Slam trophy.I arrive (at) this decision to say goodbye to the tennis with my heart, Schiavone said. Because my head, when I arrive here, says, `Please go to the court, fight, because I can beat many other players. But my heart says that I am (at) peace like this, that I am very happy about my career, my life, and everything. Schiavone _ its pronounced Skee-ah-VOH-nay _ really came out of nowhere at the French Open eight years ago, beating Sam Stosur 6-4, 7-6 (2) in the final to become the first woman from Italy to win a major singles championship. Afterward, she kissed the courts red clay. Seeded only 17th, she defeated three top-10 opponents along the way, plus No. 11 Li Na in a third-round match Schiavone considers the most beautiful match of that Slam. She had never been past the quarterfinals at 38 previous Grand Slam appearances. Just shy of her 30th birthday at the time, she was the oldest woman since 1969 to win her first major trophy. That title propelled her to a career-best No. 6 in the WTA rankings, making her the oldest woman since 1998 to make her top-10 debut.
