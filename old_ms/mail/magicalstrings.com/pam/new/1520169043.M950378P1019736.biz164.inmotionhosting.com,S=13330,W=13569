Get Business Funding Without The Bankers?

Pam, if you're on the hunt for funding for your company but hitting a wall =
searching for traditional bank loans, please read this email carefully, it =
might save you from weeks of frustrating paperwork and the dreaded "rejecti=
on letter"...

My name is Jeff Chalela, VP of Operations at Keystone Expansion Advisors, a=
 strategic funding group that can match you with the perfect loan type for =
your company. No matter how niche or how "unfundable" you think your busine=
ss might be, we can get you the right funding for your needs, and best of a=
ll you can skip the miles of lines
and paperwork your local bank will force you to sit through.

Get approved for up to $500K and kickstart your business within 48 Hours, E=
VEN IF:

- You've already been turned down for a SBA / bank loan
- You have bad or NO business credit (we don't even check your credit!)
- You've given up on funding your company all together=E2=80=A6

(By the way, Pam... part of our service is to consult with you to find the =
right loan type for your company, that means we'll help you wade through al=
l the options and steer you towards a funding partner that has your best in=
terests in mind. More on that below=E2=80=A6.)

Even if you don't think you would qualify, I guarantee it's worth the minim=
al time investment to apply just to find out what's available for you becau=
se 90% who've already been rejected by the banks get approved.

I'd love to get you set up for a complimentary consultation and cash flow a=
nalysis, Pam, it's a quick process that will give you clarity on your fundi=
ng options, how much cash you might be eligible, and how quickly you can ha=
ve it in your bank. There's no obligations for this process, by the way.

Just reply "YES" if you're interested and I'll get you all the details ASAP.

Sincerely,

Jeff Chalela
VP Operations
