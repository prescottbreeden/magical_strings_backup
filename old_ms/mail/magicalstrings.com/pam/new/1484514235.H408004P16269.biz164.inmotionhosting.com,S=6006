Hi there,

Turns out we need to reschedule - Feb 12th does not work for Sue and Gary,
and since Sue started this it seems unsporting to have it without them.

The extra 'black fly in the chardonnay' is that I can't host until May.. my
second job at a tax accounting office is getting busy - having 30 plus
people over is not on my agenda for awhile. Collapsing like a cheap tent is
though.

So we need a new date and a new host house if we're to do this before May.

Any ideas?
Best, Frances & Ed
