 Content preview:  submit to reddit Wanda Barzee, who infamously helped Brian
    David Mitchell kidnap Elizabeth Smart back in 2002, was nowhere to be found
    Tuesday morning at her own parole hearing, which she apparently refused to
    attend. Smart didnt attend the parole hearing in time although she tried
   to, KUTV reported. She also had plenty to say about Barzee, including that
    she believes she has not changed. A member of the Pardons and Parole board
    commented on the 72-year-old womans absence by saying It is my understanding
    that Mrs. Barzee has refused to attend her hearing. Shes not acting like
   a person that is trying to change the way she previously was, he said.Once
    she gets out she would probably pick up where she left off. Even Scott Williams,
    Barzees attorney, was surprised his client didnt show. Elizabeth Smart was
    pleased to hear Barzee is still behind bars. http://www.midtnord.com/Jnlisan/nlbnqn5267vznyx/a9nH7B2Kh0w67QojfI2L1Y9zDebSCsoYN_YRBnmpBPY/LgHQpmFFHFfHDlDKSczkbJ5gTsD09OuFx7Ed56F8KQCAprSivBp_LEXl5RpsMAgBH4RPB4oOusq4Wbw9sUUKy-nDOqexE4AihQetLC5ObqQKneM5YmDxrfklzPZtUWyE
    Its only 11:00am and today has already been an eventful day. This morning
    was the parole hearing for Wanda Barzee, one of the people who kidnapped

    was I got to the state prison once it was already over , that was just due
    to a silly mix up. And the good news is she was not released. Smart, who
   was kidnapped when she was 14, said she believes her captor has not changed
    because shes learned that Barzee is still reading a manuscript about kidnapping
    young girls. But I have recently learned that she is still carrying around
    a manuscript called. [...]
