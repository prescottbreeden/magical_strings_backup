Hi all,

Let's try to get together again. How about early February? I was thinking a
Sunday afternoon (as long as there isn't a Seahawks game). So ponder
whether Feb 5th or 12th works better for you and let me know. I know this
is way too soon to be asking - if you can let me know sometime in January
that'd be great.

I am 'BCC'ing the list so you can just respond to me and emails don't start
pinging around and become annoying. Also, if there is a neighbor you'd like
to invite please either send me their email or put them in touch with me.
Our house is only so big and I need to assess how many folks will fit
comfortably.


Happy T-day,
Frances & Ed
