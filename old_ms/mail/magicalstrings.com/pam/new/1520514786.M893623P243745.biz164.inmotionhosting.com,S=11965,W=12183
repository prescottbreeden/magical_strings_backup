Hi Pam,

I sent you a proposal recently with information on alternative funding for =
your company. Did you receive that?

It's Jeff, VP of Operations at Keystone Expansion Advisors, and my company =
has built a name for itself by helping small companies like yours navigate =
the complexities of business funding and steering them towards the right lo=
an for you.

Even if you've already received a dozen rejection notices from the banks, y=
ou can still get up to $500K in funding for your company. We excel at helpi=
ng small businesses find the right funding solution for them.

We'll help you grow your company, hire your next rockstar employee, maintai=
n positive cashflow or get the equipment you need at the right rates for yo=
u.

Can I get you details on how we approve 90% of applicants for up to $500K F=
AST?

I'd also love to get you setup with one of our finance strategy sessions=E2=
=80=A6 it's a complimentary session with our funding experts to help you ma=
p out a way forward and to locate the right loan for your business.

If we find a great loan for you, we'll walk you through the application pro=
cess, and there's no credit check so no credit event gets logged with the r=
eporting agencies. It's truly zero-risk and no obligations.

Just hit reply and let me know if you need more details and I'll get it to =
you right away.

Sincerely,
Jeff Chalela

Jeff Chalela
