 Content preview:  Hi Pam I thought you might be interested in this new whitepaper
    - InsideHPC: Guide to Personalized Medicine and Genomics This whitepaper
   will introduce you to how HPC (High Performance Computing) is becoming more
    affordable, faster, less complex and easier to use. It will show how these
    developments can facilitate the acceleration of personalized medicine. Genomic
