r. Susan Peirce Thompson, professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and author of the New York Times best-selling book, Bright Line Eating, coins the term insatiable hunger for this phenomenon. Insatiable hunger is characterized by two main attributes its not satisfied by eating, and its often associated with a desire to stay sedentary This is at odds with how humans are biologiclly programmed. Back in the hunter-gatheer days, people experienced hunger differently When the berry bushes were heavy with fruit, or thee ha been a sucessful hunt, the whole village would gorge on calories with the expectation that it might be days until the next meal This massive caloric intake was accompanied by an urge to get activeto go find a mate, build a hut, or hea out in search of the next source of protein. In other words, we were cued to put those calories to use for activities linked to survival Humans were also programmed for something caled ompensation which is the brains regulatory mechanism for preventing the accumulation of excess weight. With compensation on board, if you eat one large meal in the morning, youre naturally inclined to eat less for the rest of the day Parents of young children may recognize this phenomenon in their kids who, after eating a big lunch, will respond by marginally picking at dinner In the same chapter, Dr Thompson illustrates an average Americans relationship with food, examining how it is diametriclly opposite from the habits of primitive man Think of our modern activitieseating in front of the TV, eating while reding a book, eating while chcking email or surfing the web, eating at a sporting event, eating at the movies, eating in our cars We have turned life into a continuous, sedentary buffet Hers whats going on in our brains when we eat this way

<div style="box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 14px;">r. Susan Peirce Thompson, professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and author of the New York Times best-selling book, Bright Line Eating, coins the term &ldquo;insatiable hunger&rdquo; for this phenomenon. Insatiable hunger is characterized by two main attributes it&rsquo;s not satisfied by eating, and it&rsquo;s often associated with a desire to stay sedentary This is at odds with how humans are biologiclly programmed. Back in the hunter-gatheer days, people experienced hunger differently When the berry bushes were heavy with fruit, or thee ha been a sucessful hunt, the whole village would gorge on calories with the expectation that it might be days until the next meal This massive caloric intake was accompanied by an urge to get active&mdash;to go find a mate, build a hut, or hea out in search of the next source of protein. In other words, we were cued to put those calories to use for activities linked to survival Humans were also programmed for something caled ompensation which is the brain&rsquo;s regulatory mechanism for preventing the accumulation of excess weight. With compensation on board, if you eat one large meal in the morning, you&rsquo;re naturally inclined to eat less for the rest of the day Parents of young children may recognize this phenomenon in their kids who, after eating a big lunch, will respond by marginally picking at dinner In the same chapter, Dr Thompson illustrates an average American&rsquo;s relationship with food, examining how it is diametriclly opposite from the habits of primitive man &ldquo;Think of our modern activities&mdash;eating in front of the TV, eating while reding a book, eating while chcking email or surfing the web, eating at a sporting event, eating at the movies, eating in our cars We have turned life into a continuous, sedentary buffet Hers what&rsquo;s going on in our brains when we eat this way</div>
