Dear Friends of Channa,

As many of you know, our dear Channa Seidenberg has suffered a serious
fracture of her femur while teaching in China. Because her condition
doesn=E2=80=99t allow for travel at this time, Channa is scheduled to have =
major
surgery in Shijiazhuang next week and will recover there for at least two
weeks before flying home. Her sons Julian and Andreas are with her now.


The main focus right now is on Channa=E2=80=99s well-being and securing the=
 best
care possible for her.  Also of concern for the family are the rapidly
mounting medical expenses. There are complications regarding the insurance,
and since she is overseas, it is not at all clear that these costs will be
covered. In addition, there are huge fees related to the special
accommodations Channa will need on the plane when she is able to return
home.


At this time, we are turning to you with a request for financial
assistance. *Whatever you can offer will help defray some of these
overwhelming costs. *We are deeply grateful for your donations as well as
your heart- felt prayers.


Over the years, Channa has made it a priority to bring people together to
create music. She has built community through work with the lyre and
singing, as well as through her laughter and her generosity as a thoughtful
friend, therapist, and colleague.  Now our priority is to help Channa
through this medical crisis so that she can concentrate on healing and
recovery.


  With love and *much* appreciation,


       Cate Decker
                             on behalf of the Seidenberg Family



*Please make checks payable to Channa=E2=80=99s daughter-in-law:

*Juliet Seidenberg *and mail to

* P.O. Box 488, Philmont, NY 12565*



For further information, please contact Cate at chdecker2@gmail.com
