Greetings,

Am Mrs Daniella Johnson, having no family because I and my late husband had no children before his death. I was diagnosed long time a go with a cancer in my lungs,so I took the decision to leave all of my heritage which is 17.5 million Dollars sterling to a charity organization or an individual with a good character so that the money be used to build an orphanage, hospitals or any other actions in the field of Charities to Children disinherits.

I want these fund to be invested wisely so that all actions can be sustained.So If you are of good character or know of a charity organization or a person working for the underprivileged and children with the fear of God please contact me as soon as possible because I am very weakened by the disease and do not know if I will keep the two months which I have been given.

Am not doing this to gain any recognition from any one but am doing it to fulfill the promise l gave to God that l must dedicate all my entire life to the orphans and the need for my parents died when l was very tender.

I know this may not earn me the gates of paradise, but at least my conscience will now be at peace knowing that I have contributed a little to make this world a better place for the less privileged.

May God bless you.
Mrs. Daniella Johnson.
