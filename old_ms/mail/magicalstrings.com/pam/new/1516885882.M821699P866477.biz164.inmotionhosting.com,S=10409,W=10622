Hi Pam,

I've got a=C2=A0time sensitive and confidential funding proposal=C2=A0for M=
agical Strings...

If your business is 100% perfect the way it is, you can STOP reading now...=
 this isn't for you.

On the other hand, if you're like most businesses, and you're struggling to=
 grow, hire your next rock star employee,
bankroll your next office space, or hit your sales numbers...

Or have any need at all for a game-changing cash injection...

Then this proposal is for you, Pam... so please read this carefully.

I'll cut to the chase...

My name is Lindsey Miller and my firm The Merchant Lender, can get you appr=
oved for business funding within 24
hours and get you cash for your business needs within 48 hours.

Yes, it's that easy - no crazy approval wait times and it's zero cost to ap=
ply.

We can get you=C2=A0business funding up to $500k=C2=A0within 48 hours.

Even if you don't think you would qualify, I guarantee it's worth the no-co=
st application just to find out what's available
to you...

I can get you all the information you need so you can make an informed deci=
sion, sometimes all a business needs is
a financial bump so they can reach the next level or avoid bankruptcy.

Just reply "YES" if you're interested and I'll get you more information ASA=
P.

Sincerely,
Lindsey
