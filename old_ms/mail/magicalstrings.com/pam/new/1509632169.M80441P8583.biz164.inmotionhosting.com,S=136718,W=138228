Terms and Conditions


 1. Welcome bonus offer not available to applicants who have or have had this product. This offer is intended for the email recipient only. The RSVP code is unique and can only be used one time. If you are not the intended recipient, please call 
tel:1-800-276-2152 
1‑800‑276‑2151  to learn more about other Card offers. If your application is not received by 12/1/2017, we will not process your application even if we later receive your application. American Express reserves the right to modify or revoke offer at any time. To be eligible to earn additional points, you must charge $10,000 of qualifying purchases* during the first 3 months of membership on an eligible Business Platinum Card from American Express OPEN. Qualifying purchases can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card Account. Limit one offer per Card Account. Offer may not be combined with any other special offer. Your account must be in good
 standing and not in default at the time of fulfillment of any offers. The 100,000 points will be credited to your Membership Rewards account 8-12 weeks after you have met the purchase requirement. You can earn 100,000 points after you spend $10,000 or more in qualifying purchases on your Card within your first 3 months of Card Membership starting from the date your account is approved. In rare instances, your period to spend $10,000 may be shorter than 3 months if there is a delay in receiving your Card. Also, purchases may fall outside of the 3 month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the
 transaction. (For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped). The 100,000 additional points will be credited to your Membership Rewards account 8-12 weeks after you have met the purchase requirement. If we in our sole discretion determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with the welcome bonus offer in any way or that you intend to do so (for example, if you applied for one or more cards to obtain a welcome bonus offer(s) that we did not intend for you; if you cancel or downgrade your account within 12 months after acquiring it; or if you cancel or return purchases you made to meet the Threshold Amount), we may
 not credit Membership Rewards points to, we may freeze Membership Rewards points credited to, or we may take away Membership Rewards points from your account. We may also cancel this Card account and other Card accounts you may have with us.


 * Purchases to meet the spend requirement do NOT include fees or interest charges, purchases of travelers checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards; person-to-person payments or purchases of other cash equivalents. Additional terms and restrictions apply.


 Terms and Conditions for the Membership Rewards(r) program apply. Visit membershiprewards.com/terms for more information. Participating partners and available rewards are subject to change without notice.


 The value of Membership Rewards points varies according to how you choose to use them. To learn more, go to 
www.membershiprewards.com/pointsinfo 
www.membershiprewards.com/pointsinfo .


 2. To use Pay with Points, you must charge your eligible airfare purchase through American Express Travel to a Membership Rewards(r) program-enrolled American Express(r) Card. Points will be debited from your Membership Rewards account, and credit for corresponding dollar amount will be issued to the American Express Card account used. If points redeemed do not cover entire amount, the balance of purchase price will remain on the American Express Card account. Points must be used at the time of booking. Pay with Points requires a minimum redemption of 5,000 points.


 Business Platinum Card Members will receive 3.5 extra points for every 10 points they redeem for either a First or Business class flight on any airline, or for flights with their selected qualifying airline using Membership Rewards Pay with Points through American Express Travel (35% Airline Bonus), up to 500,000 bonus points per calendar year, per each Membership Rewards account. For First or Business class flights on a Card Member's selected qualifying airline, the Card Member will still receive only 3.5 extra points for every 10 points redeemed. Card Member must select a qualifying airline at 
www.americanexpress.com/airlinechoice 
www.americanexpress.com/airlinechoice . Only the Basic Card Member or Authorized Account Manager(s) on the Card Account can select the qualifying airline. The airline you select for the 35% Airline Bonus and the $200 Airline Fee Credit must be the same. Card Members who have not chosen a qualifying airline will be able to do so at any time. Card Members who have already selected a qualifying airline will be able to change their choice one time each year in January at 
www.americanexpress.com/airlinechoice 
www.americanexpress.com/airlinechoice  or by calling the number on the back of your Card. Card Members who do not change their airline selection will remain with their current airline.


 If you select Spirit Airlines, Southwest Airlines, or AirTran Airways, to receive your 35% Airline Bonus you must call Business Platinum Travel Service at 
tel:1-800-553-9497 
1‑800‑553‑9497 . A flight booked as part of a travel package or booked with the American Express U.S. Representative Travel Network is not eligible for the 35% Airline Bonus. In addition, to be eligible to receive extra points, Card account(s) must not be cancelled or past due at the time of extra points fulfillment. If booking is canceled, the extra points will be deducted from your Membership Rewards account. Extra points will be credited to your Membership Rewards account approximately 6-10 weeks after eligible airfare purchases appear on your billing statement. See 
membershiprewards.com/terms 
membershiprewards.com/terms  for Membership Rewards program terms and conditions. This 35% Airline Bonus is the maximum Membership Rewards points you can get back for Pay with Points on flights booked through American Express Travel. Bonus ID: A6ZB.


 3. You will get one point for each dollar charged for an eligible purchase on your Business Platinum Card(r) from American Express. You will get 4 additional points (for a total of 5 points) for each dollar spent on eligible travel purchases made on 
amextravel.com 
amextravel.com . Eligible travel purchases include the following purchases made on amextravel.com: scheduled flights, prepaid hotel purchases (including hotels and flight+hotel packages), minus returns and other credits. Eligible travel purchases do NOT include non-prepaid hotel bookings, car rentals and cruise, hotel group reservations or events, ticketing service, cancellation or other fees, interest charges, purchases of travelers checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. To be eligible for the 5x Membership Rewards points, you must both reserve and charge the travel purchase with the same eligible Business Platinum Card(r). To modify a
 reservation you must cancel and rebook your reservation. You can cancel and rebook your reservation on amextravel.com or by calling a representative of 
amextravel.com 
amextravel.com  at 
tel:1-800-297-2977 
1‑800‑297‑2977 . Cancellations are subject to hotel cancellation penalty policies. If hotel reservations are made or modified directly with the hotel provider, the reservation will not be eligible for this 5X Membership Rewards point benefit. Extra points for air, prepaid hotel, and travel packages will be credited to the Membership Rewards account 10-12 weeks after final payment is made. Bonuses you may receive with your Card on other purchase categories or in connection with promotions or offers from American Express may not be combined with this benefit. Merchants are assigned codes based on what they primarily sell. A purchase will not qualify for additional points if the merchant's
 code is not eligible. The benefits associated with the Additional Card(s) you choose may be different than the benefits associated with your basic Card.


 See 
membershiprewards.com/terms 
membershiprewards.com/terms  for the Membership Rewards program terms and conditions or to learn the benefits associated with the Additional Card(s) you choose, please call the number on the back of your Card. American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc., when acting solely as a sales agent for travel suppliers, is not responsible for the actions or inactions or such suppliers.


 4. You get 1.5 Membership Rewards(r) points per dollar (that's an extra one-half point per dollar) for each single eligible purchase transaction of $5,000 or more made with your Business Platinum Card. For example, for a single eligible purchase transaction of $5,000, you will get an extra 2,500 points. These extra points are in addition to any points you already get from using the Card. You can get a maximum of 1,000,000 extra points associated with this benefit per calendar year per account.


 You will not get the extra points associated with this benefit if American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible for the benefit. For example, a purchase transaction of $5,000 or more will not qualify if the merchant divides the purchase into transactions of less than $5,000 before providing the information to American Express. Airlines, hotels, retailers, aggregators, and online marketplaces are a few examples of merchants that may divide purchases into smaller transactions. Transactions may be divided by date of availability, shipping date, ticket, or reservation, among other things.


 Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, purchases of travelers checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. You will typically receive the extra Membership Rewards points eight to twelve weeks after the billing period in which you make the eligible purchase.

 6. Benefit is available to Consumer and Business Platinum Card(r) and Centurion(r) Members only. To receive statement credits of up to $200 per calendar year toward incidental air travel fees, Card Member must select one qualifying airline at 
www.americanexpress.com/airlinechoice 
www.americanexpress.com/airlinechoice . Qualifying airlines include Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Spirit Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines. Only the Basic Card Member or Authorized Account Manager(s) on the Card Account can select the qualifying airline. Card Members who have not chosen one qualifying airline will be able to do so at any time. Card Members who have already selected one qualifying airline will be able to change their choice one time each year in January at 
www.americanexpress.com/airlinechoice 
www.americanexpress.com/airlinechoice  or by calling the number on the back of the Card. Card Members who do not change their airline selection will remain with their current airline. Statement Credits: Incidental air travel fees must be charged to the Card Member on the eligible Card Account for the benefit to apply. Incidental air travel fees charged by both the Basic and Additional Card Members on the eligible Card Account are eligible for statement credits. However, each Card Account is eligible for up to a total of $200 per calendar year in statement credits across all Cards on the Account. Incidental air travel fees must be separate charges from airline ticket charges. Fees not
 charged by the Card Member's airline of choice (e.g. wireless internet and fees incurred with airline alliance partners) do not qualify for statement credits. Incidental air travel fees charged prior to selection of a qualifying airline are not eligible for statement credits. Airline tickets, upgrades, mileage points purchases, mileage points transfer fees, gift cards, duty free purchases, and award tickets are not deemed to be incidental fees. The airline must submit the charge under the appropriate merchant code, industry code, or required service or product identifier for the charge to be recognized as an incidental air travel fee. Please allow 2-4 weeks after the qualifying incidental
 air travel fee is charged to your Card Account for statement credit(s) to be posted to the Account. We rely on airlines to submit the correct information on airline transactions, so please call the number on the back of the Card if statement credits have not posted after 4 weeks from the date of purchase. Card Members remain responsible for timely payment of all charges. To be eligible for this benefit, Card Account(s) must be not cancelled and not past due at the time of statement credit fulfillment. If a charge for any incidental air travel fee is included in a Pay Over Time feature balance on your Card Account (for example, Sign & Travel), the statement credit associated with that
 charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time feature balance. Instead, the statement credit may be applied to your Pay In Full balance. For additional information about this benefit, call the number on the back of your Card.


 7. The benefit is available to (i) Corporate Gold Card Members, (ii) Consumer Platinum Card(r) Members, Corporate Platinum Card(r) Members and Business Platinum Card(r) Members, and (iii) Centurion(r) Card Members. The benefit is also available to Additional Platinum and Centurion Card Members on eligible Consumer and Business Card accounts. To receive the statement credit, Additional Platinum and Centurion Card Members must charge the application fee to the eligible Additional Card account. Card Members are eligible to receive statement credit every 4 years for the application fee for either Global Entry or TSA Pre√(r) when charged to an eligible Card. Card Members will receive a
 statement credit for the first program (either Global Entry or TSA Pre√(r)) to which they apply and pay for with their eligible Card regardless of whether they are approved for Global Entry or TSA Pre√(r). However, Card Members can receive no more than one $85 credit or $100 credit, depending on which program the Card Member first applies for, every 4 years for an application fee charged to an eligible Card. American Express has no control over the application and/or approval process for Global Entry or TSA Pre√(r), and does not have access to any information provided to the government by the Card Member or by the government to the Card Member. American Express has no liability regarding
 the Global Entry or TSA Pre√(r) Programs. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) (for Global Entry) and U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) (for TSA Pre√(r)) charge an application fee to process each respective application regardless of whether the Card Member's application is approved. American Express will provide a statement credit for the application fee regardless of the decision made by CBP (for Global Entry) or TSA (for TSA Pre√(r)) but will not provide a statement credit for subsequent application fees charged to the same eligible Card within 4 years, even if the original application is rejected.


 Membership for Global Entry or TSA Pre√(r) is per person, and a separate application must be completed for each individual.


 For additional information on the Global Entry or TSA Pre√(r) programs, including information regarding the application and/or approval process and for a list of participating airlines and airports, as well as the full terms and conditions of the programs, please go to 
www.globalentry.gov 
www.globalentry.gov  for Global Entry and 
www.tsa.gov 
www.tsa.gov  for TSA Pre√(r). The Global Entry or TSA Pre√(r) programs are subject to change, and American Express has no control over those changes.

The statement credit benefit applies to the Global Entry or TSA Pre√(r) programs only. Other program applications including, but not limited to, NEXUS, SENTRI, and Privium are not eligible for the statement credit benefit.


 Please allow up to 8 weeks after the qualifying Global Entry or TSA Pre√(r) transaction is charged to the eligible Card account for the statement credit to be posted to the Card account. American Express relies on accurate transaction data to identify eligible Global Entry and TSA Pre√(r) purchases. If you do not see a credit for a qualifying purchase on your eligible Card after 8 weeks, simply call the number on the back of your Card. Card Members are responsible for payment of all application charges until the statement credit posts to the Card account. To be eligible for this benefit, Card account(s) must be active through the time of statement credit fulfillment.

Global Entry Fee Credit Option:

 Global Entry is a CBP program that allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk international travelers upon arrival in the United States. Global Entry membership also includes access to the TSA Pre√(r) program with no additional application or fee required. If a Card Member applies separately for TSA Pre√(r) with the same eligible Card, the TSA Pre√(r) application fee is not eligible for a statement credit.


 To receive the $100 Global Entry statement credit, Card Members must pay for the $100 Global Entry application fee with an eligible Card. Additional Cards on eligible Consumer and Business accounts are also eligible for the $100 statement credit. To receive the statement credit, the Global Entry application fee must be charged on the eligible Additional Card. Global Entry members can opt-in to TSA Pre√(r) by entering their Global Entry membership number (PASS ID) in the "Known Traveler Number" field each time a flight reservation is made on a participating airline. Alternatively, Card Members can add their Global Entry PASS ID to their frequent flyer profile(s) with the participating
 airline(s) and then ensure that their frequent flyer number is entered for each flight booking. If approved, membership into the Global Entry program is valid for 5 years and subject to the program's terms and conditions. You must re-apply for the Global Entry program every five years for continuous benefits.

TSA Pre√(r) Fee Credit Option:

 TSA Pre√(r) is an intelligence driven risk based program managed by TSA that allows low-risk travelers to experience faster, more efficient screening at participating U.S. airport checkpoints for domestic and international travel. The TSA Pre√(r) application program is a DHS Trusted Traveler program. TSA began accepting TSA Pre√(r) applications on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2013. Enrolling in TSA Pre√(r) does not guarantee selection for expedited screening each time a passenger travels.


 To receive the $85 TSA Pre√(r) statement credit, Card Members must pay for the $85 TSA Pre√(r) application fee with an eligible Card. Additional Cards on eligible Consumer and Business Card accounts are also eligible for the $85 statement credit. To receive the statement credit, the TSA Pre√(r) application fee must be charged on the eligible Additional Card. If approved, Membership into the TSA Pre√(r) program is valid for 5 years and subject to the program's terms and conditions.

         <br>
         1. <b>Welcome bonus offer not available to applicants who have or have had this product. This offer is intended for the email recipient only. The RSVP code is unique and can only be used one time.</b> If you are not the intended recipient, please call <a href="tel:1-800-276-2152">1‑800‑276‑2151
</a> to learn more about other Card offers. If your application is not received by 12/1/2017, we will not process your application even if we later receive your application. American Express reserves the right to modify or revoke offer at any time. To be eligible to earn additional points, you must charge $10,000 of qualifying purchases* during the first 3 months of membership on an eligible Business Platinum Card from American Express OPEN. Qualifying purchases can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card Account. Limit one offer per Card Account. Offer may not be combined with any other special offer. Your account must be in good standing and not
 in default at the time of fulfillment of any offers. The 100,000 points will be credited to your Membership Rewards account 8-12 weeks after you have met the purchase requirement. You can earn 100,000 points after you spend $10,000 or more in qualifying purchases on your Card within your first 3 months of Card Membership starting from the date your account is approved. In rare instances, your period to spend $10,000 may be shorter than 3 months if there is a delay in receiving your Card. Also, purchases may fall outside of the 3 month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. (For
 example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped). The 100,000 additional points will be credited to your Membership Rewards account 8-12 weeks after you have met the purchase requirement. If we in our sole discretion determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with the welcome bonus offer in any way or that you intend to do so (for example, if you applied for one or more cards to obtain a welcome bonus offer(s) that we did not intend for you; if you cancel or downgrade your account within 12 months after acquiring it; or if you cancel or return purchases you made to meet the Threshold Amount), we may not
 credit&nbsp;Membership Rewards points to, we may freeze&nbsp;Membership Rewards points credited to, or we may take away&nbsp;Membership Rewards points from&nbsp;your account. We may also cancel this Card account and other Card accounts you may have with us.<br>
         <br>
         * Purchases to meet the spend requirement do NOT include fees or interest charges, purchases of travelers checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards; person-to-person payments or purchases of other cash equivalents. Additional terms and restrictions apply.<br>
         <br>
         Terms and Conditions for the Membership Rewards<sup>&#174;</sup> program apply. Visit membershiprewards.com/terms for more information. Participating partners and available rewards are subject to change without notice.<br>
         <br>
         The value of Membership Rewards points varies according to how you choose to use them. To learn more, go to <a href="http://cl.exct.net/?qs=0e32421a8dec06378b675020506e865440d3740fa11160c63a63e98966c02a10c619ef25a90de9d7b8922f125bc24a252767920342597775">www.membershiprewards.com/pointsinfo</a>.<br>
         <br>
         2. To use Pay with Points, you must charge your eligible airfare purchase through American Express Travel to a Membership Rewards<sup>&#174;</sup> program-enrolled American Express<sup>&#174;</sup> Card. Points will be debited from your Membership Rewards account, and credit for corresponding dollar amount will be issued to the American Express Card account used. If points redeemed do not cover entire amount, the balance of purchase price will remain on the American Express Card account. Points must be used at the time of booking. Pay with Points requires a minimum redemption of 5,000 points.<br>
         <br>
         Business Platinum Card Members will receive 3.5 extra points for every 10 points they redeem for either a First or Business class flight on any airline, or for flights with their selected qualifying airline using Membership Rewards Pay with Points through American Express Travel (35% Airline Bonus), up to 500,000 bonus points per calendar year, per each Membership Rewards account. For First or Business class flights on a Card Member's selected qualifying airline, the Card Member will still receive only 3.5 extra points for every 10 points redeemed. Card Member must select a qualifying airline at 
<a href="http://cl.exct.net/?qs=0e32421a8dec06370cec7ba3547337d711e7e5716c02eb3718a3af4ceb5142ec3348ce05a3735283308e3b3d06df84761756f16c49ed1cdc">www.americanexpress.com/airlinechoice</a>. Only the Basic Card Member or Authorized Account Manager(s) on the Card Account can select the qualifying airline.

For example, a purchase transaction of $5,000 or more will not qualify if the merchant divides the purchase into transactions of less than $5,000 before providing the information to American Express. Airlines, hotels, retailers, aggregators, and online marketplaces are a few examples of merchants that may divide purchases into smaller transactions. Transactions may be divided by date of availability, shipping date, ticket, or reservation, among other things.<br>
         <br>
         Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, purchases of travelers checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. You will typically receive the extra Membership Rewards points eight to twelve weeks after the billing period in which you make the eligible purchase.<br>
