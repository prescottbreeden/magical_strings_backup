 Content preview:  Aloha Philip&Pam- We are all missing you here at Napili Bay.
    Having a Wonderful visit as usual. I'm belated in thanking you for your "magical"
    Christmas card. I've been on Maui since Dec29 , so it was forwarded here
   to me from Ca. I've had it on my dresser and see your sweet faces and loving
    words each day. Ireland is so special, so I understand your time there. Need
    to return there myself. I've had a healthy and happy year (apart from the
    hole in my heart). Traveled to San Miguel de Allende, cruised from Boston
    to Montreal and spent 2 1/2 weeks in Lombardy and Piedmont regions of Italy.
    It is always so fulfilling to be here on Maui surrounded by loving friends.
    ðŸ’–ðŸ’ž I hope it will be back on your schedule for 2018. With loving wishes
    for this New Year, ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜. Tracey [...]
