any surprise. Well, M. dHerblay? Well, sire, all is accomplished. How? Exactly as we expected. Did he resist? Terribly! tears and entreaties. And then? A perfect stupor. But at last? Oh! at last, a complete victory, and absolute silence. Did the governor of the Bastile suspect anything? Nothing. The resemblance, however Was the cause of the success. But the prisoner cannot fail to explain himself. Think well of that. I have myself been able to do as much as that, on former occasion. I have already providedday. Well, said the surintendant, more astonished than annoyed by this frankness, if there is nothing disagreeable predicted to you by your sword, I am to conclude that it is not disagreeable for you to arrest me.

Are you going out? said Fouquet. Yes, monseigneur. And you? I shall remain. You pledge your word? Certainly. Very good.
