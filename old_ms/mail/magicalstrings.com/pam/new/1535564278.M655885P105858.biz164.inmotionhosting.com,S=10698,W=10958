Hi Pam,

 

Out of respect for your time, I will get right to the point. We help in
outreach activities through mailing lists, email and data append services
and customer database hygiene services. 

 

I am writing because we would like to work with you and provide lists based
on your target requirements and accelerate your pool of leads. Our lists are
current and come with a replacement assurance. 

 

I would like to make a quick case why this collaboration is going to be a
good decision for you:

1.       Error free lists facilitate a laser focused team.

2.       We replace and compensate all erroneous contacts based on our
contract - zero errors in practice.

3.       We are passionate about your because the ultimate measure of any
list is the result.

4.       Our in house team of researchers and quality experts ensure real
time data - for all over the world.

5.       Mailing lists come with multiple data elements including email
addresses, phone and fax numbers, and postal addresses.

6.       We also update and validate your existing database - our scheduled
updates take care of the future.

 

We are keen on delivering substantial value and business benefits through
our services. The easiest way for us to evaluate this potential
collaboration would be a complimentary set of 100 contacts for analysis. 

 

Please share your target requirements (Industry; Job Titles; Geography) and
I shall revert back with 100 contacts for review. 

 

Thanks

 

Gladys Pruitt
