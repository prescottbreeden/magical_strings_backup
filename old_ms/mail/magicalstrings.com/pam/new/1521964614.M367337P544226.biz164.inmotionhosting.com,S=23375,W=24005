You dont have to cover up your head this Winter - instead walk proudly with a full head of hair you can show off. New technology allows hair follicles to regrow in practically an instant.

Start getting your hair backNow!

But as the FCC moves to repeal the rules, the story is far from over. A court challenge is likely from a number of public interest groups, on the grounds that the Trump era FCC is reversing the actions of its previous majority just two years after the rules were established, and that they will have to prove that there is a reasonable rationale for doing so. 



The other argument from ISPs is that the marketplace will take care of it and that theyd be fools to alter the open platform. Any ISP that is so foolish as to seek to engage in gatekeeping will be quickly and decisively called out, said AT&amp;Ts Joan Marsh.
