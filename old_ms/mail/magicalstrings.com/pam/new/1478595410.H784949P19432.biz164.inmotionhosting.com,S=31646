HURSDAY, May 14, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- A little exercise late in life may help men live longer, new research from Norway suggests. &quot;Even in the elderly, there is a lot to gain by being moderately active as compared to being sedentary,&quot; said study lead author Ingar Holme, professor emeritus at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo. The study of older men found that increasing physical activity benefited life span as much as quitting smoking. &quot;Given the evidence, physical activity is probably an important factor in getting people to age successfully,&quot; Holme said. &quot;But there are many things that we don&#39;t know in this field.&quot; The research involved nearly 6,000 Norwegian men born from 1923 to 1932 who underwent a health check in 1972-1973 and again in 2000. Monitoring continued for almost 12 years.   Sedentary men said they spent a lot of time reading and/or watching TV. Moderate activity consisted of exercise, sports or heavy gardening for at least four hours a week, while vigorous activity involved hard training or competitive sports several times a week. Through 2011 in the study, more than 2,000 men died. Holme said 51 percent of men who were sedentary in their 70s died from any cause, compared to about one-quarter of those who were moderately to vigorously active. Just 30 minutes of moderate activity six days a week was associated with 40 percent lower risk of death, the researchers found. More exercise reaped even greater benefits, decreasing the odds of death from both heart disease or any cause, the researchers said. 




The industry sent a wish list newfoundland to Washington, but the response was not flint quite what it had expected. Two years gift ago, Ascap and BMI, the industrys two sorting giant licensing clearinghouses, petitioned the Justice Department for changes to the regulatory agreements that owl have governed them since 1941. Those documents exceeding have not been changed in at least planned 15 years and, the agencies said, were bloodshot in desperate need of updating to preserve excessive the value of in the zing age. The request came after both groups regency went through bruising litigation with Pandora Media handily over royalty rates. But this week the latino government told the agencies it planned to vocal deny their request, and added a twist musical that songwriters and industry executives say could colored further the economics of and thornton perhaps unsettle the business in fundamental ways. trample In a meeting in Washington on Wednesday, malnutrition Justice Department lawyers told representatives of Ascap scribe and BMI that the two groups, called cool performing rights organizations, must adopt a policy herpes known as 100 percent licensing, which means bronx that any that controls a part muscle of a composition can issue a license technological for the use of the whole thing. astonishment This went against decades of industry practice. restriction Although the Justice Departments recommendation carries great extremely weight, any alterations to the consent decrees patience is subject to approval by two federal motoring judges overseeing the cases, and the performing strength rights organizations could object to the changes approving in court. publishers said that instituting undecided 100 percent licensing would further depress royalty sometime rates by letting outlets like stations boating and services for whatever muddy would accept the fee. It toggle would also cause administrative pandemonium, at least uninsured in the short term, they said, and dorado cast doubt on the futures of Ascap ridge and BMI, two of the worlds rekindle most stable institutions, together processing more than siemens $2 billion a year in licensing fees. mendelsohn Their decision is like Brexit, said Martin revers Bandier, the chief executive of Sony/, the cunning largest . No one understands it. The steering Justice Departments meeting with Ascap and BMI valued was confirmed by those organizations, which issued boost a brief joint statement on Thursday saying prime that they were evaluating the information presented. shoreline The regulators are .



speak about them. A Justice conclusively Department spokesman declined to comment. The decision, anywhere if upheld by the courts, could have explanation consequences for songwriters. Those who work alone and control their intellectual property would gain columbus an advantage. Major pop hits now tend reflect to involve many songwriters, but the ranks zing of credited writers could be thinned to felicity limit the number of people who could mound potentially license the work, publishing executives said. disclosed It could also mean that musicians would indie be forced to change their writing habits peacetime based on the professional affiliations of their tracker collaborators, said Michelle Lewis, a songwriter whose agree work has been recorded by pop stars sec like Cher and Jessica Simpson, and who pertinent is a founder of the advocacy group babylon Songwriters of North America. You write with heater who you have chemistry with; their choice spade of P.R.O. should not figure into it, mysterious Ms. Lewis said. But if we have to deal with this administrative nightmare we satirical are not going to collaborate. I dont dating think the D.O.J. really understood this. When condemned the Justice Department indicated last year that multiplication it was considering 100 percent licensing, it chemotherapy caused an uproar in the industry. In sociable January, Maria A. Pallante, the register of rodgers copyrights and the director of the United anchorage States Copyright Office, wrote a 30-page memo cement saying that the practice would seemingly vitiate important principles of copyright law. Yet the frederick Justice Departments position on 100 percent licensing canary has been endorsed by technology companies, which blasting have long argued that the industry investing charges onerous fees for use of their refund material. In a federal rate-setting trial two hare years ago involving Ascap and Pandora, a unpredictable judge also warned that Ascap and ghost publishers had shown a troubling coordination in pose how they operate, giving fuel to technology bate companies complaints about the industry. Congress yamamoto is clear in the Copyright Act that southeastern each individual co-writer is authorized to license converge the whole, said Gregory Barnes, the general void counsel of the Media Association, a antigua trade group that includes tech giants .

The study of older men found that increasing physical activity benefited life span as much as quitting smoking. &quot;Given the evidence, physical activity is probably an important factor in getting people to age successfully,&quot; Holme said. &quot;But there are many things that we don&#39;t know in this field.&quot; The research involved nearly 6,000 Norwegian men born from 1923 to 1932 who underwent a health check in 1972-1973 and again in 2000. Monitoring continued for almost 12 years. </span> <span style="color:#25140D"> Sedentary men said they spent a lot of time reading and/or watching TV. Moderate activity consisted of exercise, sports or heavy gardening for at least four hours a week, while vigorous activity involved hard training or competitive sports several times a week. Through 2011 in the study, more than 2,000 men died. Holme said 51 percent of men who were sedentary in their 70s died from any cause, compared to about one-quarter of those who were moderately to vigorously active. Just 30 minutes of moderate activity six days a week was associated with 40 percent lower risk of death, the researchers found. More exercise reaped even greater benefits, decreasing the odds of death from both heart disease or any cause, the researchers said. </span></td>

Two years gift ago, Ascap and BMI, the industrys two sorting giant licensing clearinghouses, petitioned the Justice Department for changes to the regulatory agreements that owl have governed them since 1941. Those documents exceeding have not been changed in at least planned 15 years and, the agencies said, were bloodshot in desperate need of updating to preserve excessive the value of in the zing age. The request came after both groups regency went through bruising litigation with Pandora Media handily over royalty rates. But this week the latino government told the agencies it planned to vocal deny their request, and added a twist musical that songwriters and industry executives say could colored further the economics of and thornton perhaps unsettle the business in fundamental ways. trample In a meeting in Washington on Wednesday, malnutrition Justice Department lawyers told representatives of Ascap scribe and BMI that the two groups, called cool performing rights organizations, must adopt a policy herpes known as 100 percent licensing, which means bronx that any that controls a part muscle of a composition can issue a license technological for the use of the whole thing. astonishment This went against decades of industry practice. restriction Although the Justice Departments recommendation carries great extremely weight, any alterations to the consent decrees patience is subject to approval by two federal motoring judges overseeing the cases, and the performing strength rights organizations could object to the changes approving in court. publishers said that instituting undecided 100 percent licensing would further depress royalty sometime rates by letting outlets like stations boating and services for whatever muddy would accept the fee. It toggle would also cause administrative pandemonium, at least uninsured in the short term, they said, and dorado cast doubt on the futures of Ascap ridge and BMI, two of the worlds rekindle most stable institutions, together processing more than siemens $2 billion a year in licensing fees. mendelsohn Their decision is like Brexit, said Martin revers Bandier, the chief executive of Sony/, the cunning largest .

A Justice conclusively Department spokesman declined to comment. The decision, anywhere if upheld by the courts, could have explanation consequences for songwriters. Those who work alone and control their intellectual property would gain columbus an advantage. Major pop hits now tend reflect to involve many songwriters, but the ranks zing of credited writers could be thinned to felicity limit the number of people who could mound potentially license the work, publishing executives said. disclosed It could also mean that musicians would indie be forced to change their writing habits peacetime based on the professional affiliations of their tracker collaborators, said Michelle Lewis, a songwriter whose agree work has been recorded by pop stars sec like Cher and Jessica Simpson, and who pertinent is a founder of the advocacy group babylon Songwriters of North America. You write with heater who you have chemistry with; their choice spade of P.R.O. should not figure into it, mysterious Ms. Lewis said. But if we have to deal with this administrative nightmare we satirical are not going to collaborate. I dont dating think the D.O.J. really understood this. When condemned the Justice Department indicated last year that multiplication it was considering 100 percent licensing, it chemotherapy caused an uproar in the industry. In sociable January, Maria A. Pallante, the register of rodgers copyrights and the director of the United anchorage States Copyright Office, wrote a 30-page memo cement saying that the practice would seemingly vitiate important principles of copyright law. Yet the frederick Justice Departments position on 100 percent licensing canary has been endorsed by technology companies, which blasting have long argued that the industry investing charges onerous fees for use of their refund material. In a federal rate-setting trial two hare years ago involving Ascap and Pandora, a unpredictable judge also warned that Ascap and ghost publishers had shown a troubling coordination in pose how they operate, giving fuel to technology bate companies complaints about the industry. Congress yamamoto is clear in the Copyright Act that southeastern each individual co-writer is authorized to license converge the whole, said Gregory Barnes, the general void counsel of the Media Association, a antigua trade group that includes tech giants .</p>
