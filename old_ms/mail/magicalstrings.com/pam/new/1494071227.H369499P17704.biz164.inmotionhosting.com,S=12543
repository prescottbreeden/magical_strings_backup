Whats going on?
NBC is sickened by this latest setback, as Ellen will not be back next week to make America laugh

Vincent Nieland. 3015 Columbus St Muskogee Ok 74401-5138The presence of the physical keyboard dictates the KeyOnes unique display: a .inch, x pixel touchscreen with a : aspect ratio. The screen here is essentially the opposite of the elongated displays on the Galaxy S and LG G its more square than most smartphone screens, which makes it a poor fit for watching widescreen video in portrait or landscape. But BlackBerry says its great for composing email, because the KeyOnes screen can provide up to a third more usable space when typing compared to a .inch alltouch device that also has to display a keyboard on the bottom half.It wasnt that I was able to type faster with the BlackBerrys keyboard I wasnt, or that I was more accurate with it I still used autocorrect. It was that I felt like I was more productive when using it. I wasnt wasting time tweeting nonsense or sending emoji in ephemeral messages. I was sending important emails, working with my colleagues in Slack, creating and completing todo lists, and adding appointments to my calendar. I was Getting Shit Done.Getting shit done is really the entire ethos of the new KeyOne, and arguably, the many BlackBerry devices that preceded it. The KeyOne is a phone for a very specific person, one that longs for the days when the BlackBerry Bold was the most important device in the office and the majority of business communications happened over email. Its not the best choice for watching hours of YouTube videos, sending thousands of Snaps, or reading novellength ebooks though it can technically do all of those things. It is for sending email. Lots of email.The KeyOnes internal specs also speak to its productivity focus. It has a midrange Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and a giant ,mAh battery. This is the same potent combination as found in last years Moto Z Play that can provide stellar battery life, and the KeyOne is a stamina champ as a result. Most people will be able to easily get two days of use between charges; my particularly demanding routine exhausts it in one day. But the only other phone that can last a full day for me is the Z Play, so the KeyOne is at the top of the charts here. It also benefits from Qualcomms QuickCharge . fast charging and a special boost mode that can bring the phone from to percent charged in as little as minutes.
