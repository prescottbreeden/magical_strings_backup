Do This (Once a Day) to get it hard in seconds







I gave my hubby this to get it up and hard in seconds. 







Once we started I never wanted it to end

Fast forward a few years and BMW Motorrad is well and truly in the heritage inspired motorcycle business. The original R NineT Roadster has been joined by a stable of slightly lower priced and de contented siblings, each trying to capture a different kind of magic. The one that stands out the most, to me, is the R NineT Urban G/S. In the R NineT, it feels like a giant dirtbike engine, all torque and power and vibration and fury. The engine rocks to the right when you thumb the starter, and again anytime you blip the throttle. Its loud and echoes off buildings, catching unsuspecting drivers by surprise. Its a magical engine, and BMW is brilliant for having given it a new lease on life. It gives you all the great air cooled sensations, too, like the pinging as it cools once parked and the smell of hot oil in traffic. Its an absolute gem. The transmission is a less rosy story. Compared to my personal Triumph Tiger 800 and the Ducati Scrambler 1100 I reviewed recently, the transmission feels borderline agricultural. Shifts dont feel positive and finding neutral, particularly while stopped, is a challenge. The clutch is heavy and can feel a little snatchy, owing in large part to its large, single plate dry design, a BMW boxer hallmark. But small gripes aside, the NineT handles incredibly well for something with its geometry. The 19 inch front wheel should make the bike feel slower to turn, but the low center of gravity and the wide bars and long wheelbase make it feel willing to lean over while still feeling totally stable. The Urban G/S inspires a ton of confidence on a twisty road. The engine has an incredibly linear powerband, and the deep wells of torque let you be a little lazy with the shifter, which considering how not that nice it is to shift, is a good thing. The sound the bike makes is addictive, and I regularly find myself wringing the motorcycle out to redline (whatever that is theres no tachometer) just to hear that nasal blat bellow out of the single, low mounted exhaust can. The NineTs throttle response is perfect, not overly touchy, and being a cable throttle, as opposed to ride by wire, there is a beautiful tactile feel as you twist the grip. Is the R NineT Urban G/S worth its 14+ (after delivery and dealer fees) asking price? Yeah, absolutely. Like all BMW motorcycles, its beautifully screwed together, everything feels super high quality and thanks to the proven to last engine, it should outlive you. Is it going to take you around the world? No, but BMW sells plenty of other bikes that will. Will it take you and your significant other up a canyon road or to a Silver Lake coffee shop? In the words of the immortal Robert Evans, You bet your ass it will.
