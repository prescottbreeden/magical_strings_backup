**Dear Members of the Anthroposophical Society**

The non-confirmation of another term of office of Paul Mackay and Bodo
von Plato at the General Assembly, has led to the need for far-reaching
resolutions to be taken during the June retreat of the Goetheanum
Leadership. In three previous letters, we informed you about the
development up to this point, since 24th March, 2018.(1)

Paul Mackay (NL) and Bodo von Plato (DE) have contributed significantly
to the work of the Executive Council from 1996 and 2001 respectively.
Their work has been of vital importance to the Executive Council after
the death of Manfred Schmidt-Brabant (DE, 2001) and the death of Heinz
Zimmermann (CH, 2011), Sergei Prokofieff (RUS, 2014) and the retirement
of Rolf Kerler (DE, 2002), Cornelius Pietzner (USA, 2010) and the
retirement of Virginia Sease (USA, 2015) and Seija Zimmermann (FIN,
2018) up until 2018. They thus formed a bridge from the former
centralized focus on the Executive Council to the establishment of the
Goetheanum Leadership since 2012 and the current decisions in which the
Council members and Section Leaders work together as equal partners.(2)
Since 2014, this has also been stated in the Statutes of the General
Anthroposophical Society.(3) The Goetheanum Leadership took up the
development and expansion of the activities of the various Sections,
which began at the beginning of the 90s, building on their significance
for the structure and leadership of the School of Spiritual Science.

In the June retreat, all the Section Leaders together with Paul Mackay
and Bodo von Plato, as well as the current four members of the Executive
Council, confirmed the decision of 2012 to lay the full responsibility
for the School of Spiritual Science (the First Class: path of inner
development and the vocational fields of the eleven Sections) in the
responsibility of the Goetheanum Leadership. A new decision was made
that in future the members of the Executive Council will be nominated
out of the awareness of the Goetheanum Leadership from the perspective
of the School of Spiritual Science and proposed to the General Assembly
for confirmation. Initially, no addition to the Executive Council is
planned before the next General Assembly. The Council currently consists
of Justus Wittich (since 2012), Joan Sleigh (since 2013), Constanza
Kaliks (since 2015) and Matthias Girke (since 2017). At the 2019 General
Assembly, the question of another term of office for Justus Wittich is
due.

Guidance of the affairs of the First Class of the School of Spiritual
Science (confirmation of admission of membership to the First Class,
appointment of local or regional Class Holders) will be transferred to
Claus-Peter Röh, who remains responsible for the Pedagogical Section.
He will take on this task in collaboration with Joan Sleigh (for the
English-speaking members) and Dr Constanza Kaliks (for the Spanish and
Portuguese speaking members).

It was decided to dissolve the coupling of the management of the General
Anthroposophical Section with the members of the Executive Council. At
the same time Justus Wittich was appointed responsible to guide a
transparent process in which, within one year, a suitable leadership to
run this central section, taking up the tasks of the 21st century, can
beput in place. Florian Osswald (Goetheanum Leadership) and René Becker
(General Secretary of France) will support Justus Wittich in this
process. During the transitional period, Joan Sleigh will remain the
contact person for the section.

It follows from this development that the Executive Council is
particularly responsible for the care of the Anthroposophical Society,
which has since grown into a worldwide society. In the future, this must
also be visible in the execution of the General Assembly and in the
reporting and communication procedures from the Goetheanum.

Finally, the numerous tasks of Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato in the
operation of the Goetheanum Organisation were reassigned. It is
essential that the individual departments and areas such as, for
example, the building administration, the gardens, the documentation and
the art collection, are assigned to the Sections of the School of
Spiritual Science. The spiritual content of the School and the practice
within the organisation should not fall apart. For a stronger
orientation of the house organization to a suitable design of
appropriate tasks within the financial framework, a Management Group has
been commissioned. This group consists of one employee (Rebekka
Frischknecht), one member of the Goetheanum Leadership (Stefan Hasler)
and one member of the Executive Council (Justus Wittich).

With this reorganization of the conditions at the Goetheanum, the
Goetheanum Leadership has decided, by mutual agreement with Paul Mackay
and Bodo von Plato, that they no longer belong to the Goetheanum
Leadership. Both will continue their advisory work in connection with
the Goetheanum: Paul Mackay as emeritus Council member and for special
projects; Bodo von Plato in connection with Studies and Further
Education at the Goetheanum.

These decisions and setting the course, make it clear who will be
responsible for which tasks from now on. Together with you, as members
of the locational and vocational branches, groups and national
societies, we wish to prepare the next steps towards the second century
of Anthroposophy. This includes:

* the fertile consolidation of the worldwide practice of the vocational
fields in the needs of the time with the inner path of schooling of the
School of Spiritual Science;

* the enlivening of the Anthroposophical Society spread over many
countries and different cultures on the common basis of the Foundation
Stone Meditation;

* the collaborative partnership of the Goetheanum with the many
thousands of institutions and companies that work from the impulses of
Anthroposophy. In doing so, we strive for the long-term formation of a
solid foundation both for the worldwide spiritual scientific work of the
School, as well as for the preservation of the cultural heritage of
Rudolf Steiner (in this context is also the recent founding of the World
Goetheanum Association).

In the context of this step, we depend on your empathic thoughts and
your positive support. Constructive proposals are very welcome, because
only together can we create the Anthroposophical Society that we
consider necessary for the future, both at the Goetheanum and in your
respective places.

Despite all the current and longstanding challenges, we look forward
with confidence to the working year ahead and send warm and heart-felt
greetings from the Goetheanum in Dornach. Many of the Section Leaders
will soon commence their travels to all parts of the world during the
summer months, where you may meet them in your countries and be able to
share ideas with them.

**Justus Wittich and Ueli Hurter for the Goetheanum Leadership**

June 2018**

  

SUMMARY

1. The Goetheanum Leadership assumes full responsibility for the School
of Spiritual Science and will in future appoint members of the Executive
Council from the viewpoint of the perspective of the School. These will
then be proposed to the General Assembly for approval by the members.

2. The Executive Council consists of Justus Wittich, Joan Sleigh,
Constanza Kaliks and Matthias Girke. An addition to the Council is not
planned before the next General Assembly. In 2019 Justus Wittich is due
to stand for the reconfirming of another term of office.

3. The administering of the affairs of the First Class of the School of
Spiritual Science has been taken up by Claus-Peter Röh. This will be
supported by Joan Sleigh (English) and Constanza Kaliks (Spanish /
Portuguese).

4. Justus Wittich is in charge of a process responsible for setting up
the General Anthroposophical Section, within one year, with its own
leadership. The process team includes Florian Osswald and René Becker.
Joan Sleigh remains the contact person for the General Anthroposophical
Section during the transitional period.

5. The Goetheanum Leadership commissioned Rebekka Frischknecht (for the
staff), Stefan Hasler (Goetheanum Leadership) and Justus Wittich
(Executive Council) as the Management Team of the Organisation and the
Building administration.

 non-confirmation of another term of office of Paul Mackay and Bodo von Pla=
to at the General Assembly, has led to the need for far-reaching resolution=
s to be taken during the June retreat of the Goetheanum Leadership. In thre=
e previous letters, we informed you about the development up to this point,=
 since 24th March, 2018.<sup>(1)</sup></p>=0A

                        <p style=3D"margin: 0 0 15px; line-height: 1.5">Pau=
l Mackay (NL) and Bodo von Plato (DE) have contributed significantly to the=
 work of the Executive Council from 1996 and 2001 respectively. Their work =
has been of vital importance to the Executive Council after the death of Ma=
nfred Schmidt-Brabant (DE, 2001) and the death of Heinz Zimmermann (CH, 201=
1), Sergei Prokofieff (RUS, 2014) and the retirement of Rolf Kerler (DE, 20=
02), Cornelius Pietzner (USA, 2010) and the retirement of Virginia Sease (U=
SA, 2015) and Seija Zimmermann (FIN, 2018) up until 2018. They thus formed =
a bridge from the former centralized focus on the Executive Council to the =
establishment of the Goetheanum Leadership since 2012 and the current decis=
ions in which the Council members and Section Leaders work together as equa=
l partners.<sup>(2)</sup> Since 2014, this has also been stated in the Stat=
utes of the General Anthroposophical Society.<sup>(3)</sup> The Goetheanum=
=0ALeadership took up the development and expansion of the activities of th=
e various Sections, which began at the beginning of the 90s, building on th=
eir significance for the structure and leadership of the School of Spiritua=
l Science.</p>=0A

                        <p style=3D"margin: 0 0 15px; line-height: 1.5">In =
the June retreat, all the Section Leaders together with Paul Mackay and Bod=
o von Plato, as well as the current four members of the Executive Council, =
confirmed the decision of 2012 to lay the full responsibility for the Schoo=
l of Spiritual Science (the First Class: path of inner development and the =
vocational fields of the eleven Sections) in the responsibility of the Goet=
heanum Leadership. A new decision was made that in future the members of th=
e Executive Council will be nominated out of the awareness of the Goetheanu=
m Leadership from the perspective of the School of Spiritual Science and pr=
oposed to the General Assembly for confirmation. Initially, no addition to =
the Executive Council is planned before the next General Assembly. The Coun=
cil currently consists of Justus Wittich (since 2012), Joan Sleigh (since 2=
013), Constanza Kaliks (since 2015) and Matthias Girke (since 2017). At the=
 2019=0AGeneral Assembly, the question of another term of office for Justus=
 Wittich is due.</p>=0A

dance of the affairs of the First Class of the School of Spiritual Science =
(confirmation of admission of membership to the First Class, appointment of=
 local or regional Class Holders) will be transferred to Claus-Peter R=
=C3=B6h, who remains responsible for the Pedagogical Section. He will take =
on this task in collaboration with Joan Sleigh (for the English-speaking me=
mbers) and Dr Constanza Kaliks (for the Spanish and Portuguese speaking mem=
bers).</p>=0A

                        <p style=3D"margin: 0 0 15px; line-height: 1.5">It =
was decided to dissolve the coupling of the management of the General Anthr=
oposophical Section with the members of the Executive Council. At the same =
time Justus Wittich was appointed responsible to guide a transparent proces=
s in which, within one year, a suitable leadership to run this central sect=
ion, taking up the tasks of the 21st century, can beput in place. Florian O=
sswald (Goetheanum Leadership) and Ren=C3=A9 Becker (General Secretary of F=
rance) will support Justus Wittich in this process. During the transitional=
 period, Joan Sleigh will remain the contact person for the section.</p>=0A

                        <p style=3D"margin: 0 0 15px; line-height: 1.5">It =
follows from this development that the Executive Council is particularly re=
sponsible for the care of the Anthroposophical Society, which has since gro=
wn into a worldwide society. In the future, this must also be visible in th=
e execution of the General Assembly and in the reporting and communication =
procedures from the Goetheanum.</p>=0A

                        <p style=3D"margin: 0 0 15px; line-height: 1.5">Fin=
ally, the numerous tasks of Paul Mackay and Bodo von Plato in the operation=
 of the Goetheanum Organisation were reassigned. It is essential that the i=
ndividual departments and areas such as, for example, the building administ=
ration, the gardens, the documentation and the art collection, are assigned=
 to the Sections of the School of Spiritual Science. The spiritual content =
of the School and the practice within the organisation should not fall apar=
t. For a stronger orientation of the house organization to a suitable desig=
n of appropriate tasks within the financial framework, a Management Group h=
as been commissioned. This group consists of one employee (Rebekka Frischkn=
echt), one member of the Goetheanum Leadership (Stefan Hasler) and one memb=
er of the Executive Council (Justus Wittich).</p>=0A

                        <p style=3D"margin: 0 0 15px; line-height: 1.5">Wit=
h this reorganization of the conditions at the Goetheanum, the Goetheanum L=
eadership has decided, by mutual agreement with Paul Mackay and Bodo von Pl=
ato, that they no longer belong to the Goetheanum Leadership. Both will con=
tinue their advisory work in connection with the Goetheanum: Paul Mackay as=
 emeritus Council member and for special projects; Bodo von Plato in connec=
