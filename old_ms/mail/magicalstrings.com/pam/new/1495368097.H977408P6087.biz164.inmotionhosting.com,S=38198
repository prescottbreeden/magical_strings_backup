by Thomas Wolf=0D=0A=0D=0ASome people are exposed to the arts ear=
ly in life. Others, especially those born in modest=0D=0Acircumst=
ances, come to it late, or not at all. With Red Garner, an esteem=
ed artist, college professor, and beloved=0D=0Aformer Chair of th=
e Bay Chamber Concerts Board, there was virtually no exposure=0D=0A=
to the visual arts in rural Casey County, Kentucky during his chi=
ldhood. And the high point of Red=E2=80=99s early memories of=0D=0A=
music was listening to his mother play church hymns with a boogie=
-woogie bass=0D=0Aon the family piano. The arts were also far fro=
m Red=E2=80=99s mind immediately after high=0D=0Aschool =E2=80=93=
 he took no classes in arts subjects at Transylvania University a=
nd=0D=0Awhen it was time to choose a profession, he appeared dest=
ined to become an=0D=0Aaccountant.=0D=0A=0D=0ACredit the love of =
his life =E2=80=93 his college sweetheart, Peggy=0D=0A=E2=80=93 f=
or changing all that. After college, Red followed her to New York=
 in the=0D=0Alate 1930s and in order to spend as much time with h=
er as possible, he accompanied=0D=0Aher to the Metropolitan Museu=
m of Art. There he fell in love again, this time with the works o=
f Cezanne, which=0D=0Aignited a lifelong passion for art, and ult=
imately inspired a new career. A love of classical music followed=
. Red had begun by listening to jazz while=0D=0Astill in college =
(his mother=E2=80=99s bass lines had obviously paid off) and his =
earliest=0D=0Aconcert-going included a jaunt to an old tobacco ba=
rn where he peered through a=0D=0Aknot hole to watch Louis Armstr=
ong playing =E2=80=9CTiger Rag.=E2=80=9D But here again, Peggy=E2=
=80=99s=0D=0Ainfluence paid off and he discovered Mozart, Beethov=
en and other composers he began=0D=0Ato admire.=0D=0A=0D=0ABy the=
 time I first knew Red a quarter of a century later, he=0D=0Awas =
as knowledgeable a non-professional connoisseur of classical musi=
c as any=0D=0Ain our audience at Bay Chamber Concerts. Not that R=
ed would ever admit to the term. Though he clearly knew the diffe=
rence between=0D=0Aa great performance and a not-so-great one (an=
d we had plenty of both), he invariably=0D=0Awould greet me after=
 one of our programs with a twinkle in his eye and the comment=0D=0A=
=E2=80=9CI think that was the best concert ever.=E2=80=9D By that=
 time, of course, he was a distinguished=0D=0Aprofessional artist=
, the chair of a University art department in Potsdam, New=0D=0AY=
ork, and the co-owner of a retail store during the summer in Linc=
olnville,=0D=0AMaine which sold, among other things, local crafts=
 including pieces that he made=0D=0Ahimself.=0D=0A=0D=0AThe Garne=
rs moved permanently to Lincolnville in 1972, and=0D=0Acontinued =
to operate the shop for a number of years. But if Red thought he =
could now spend most of=0D=0Ahis days on his art he was mistaken.=
 Those of us in the Maine arts community wouldn=E2=80=99t=0D=0Ale=
t him. We needed leaders like Red and=0D=0Ahe cheerfully took on =
assignments on any number of arts-related boards and=0D=0Acommitt=
ees, including the former Maine Coast Artists organization, now t=
he=0D=0ACenter for Maine Contemporary Art, the Maine Arts Commiss=
ion, and, of course,=0D=0ABay Chamber Concerts where he was a lon=
g-time trustee and, for many years,=0D=0ABoard Chair. Under his l=
eadership, Bay Chamber Concerts grew and=0D=0Aprospered. What a p=
leasure it was to=0D=0Awork for him.=0D=0A=0D=0AOne=0D=0Athing I =
loved about Red was his sense of humor. He used to tease my mothe=
r who=0D=0Ahad a somewhat exaggerated pride in the talents of her=
 six children. So, after a particularly successful performance=0D=0A=
by one of us, Red would come up to her and ask: =E2=80=9CCouldn=E2=
=80=99t you have raised at=0D=0Aleast some talented children?=E2=80=
=9D With me, the teasing had to do with high-bush=0D=0Ablueberrie=
s. Red=E2=80=99s were legendary and=0D=0Awhen I tried to grow my =
own, Red knew I was struggling. He would come look at them during=
 the early summer,=0D=0Ashake his head sagely, and say on one occ=
asion, =E2=80=9CNot enough water=E2=80=9D and on the=0D=0Anext =E2=
=80=9CToo much water.=E2=80=9D And as the season wore on, while m=
y berries remained=0D=0Agreen on the vine, Red would come by with=
 a big box of his own ripe blue ones=0D=0Aand say, =E2=80=9CWell =
my crop is almost finished but I wanted to save you at least one=0D=0A=
box. How are your berries doing?=E2=80=9D He knew the answer, of =
course. He would=0D=0Aalways be champ.=0D=0A=0D=0ABay=0D=0AChambe=
