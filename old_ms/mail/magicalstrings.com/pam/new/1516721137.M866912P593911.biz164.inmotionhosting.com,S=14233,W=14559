Silence The Ringing inYour Ears This Weekend




EVERY DOCTOR SAID IT WASNT POSSIBLE

Markle called Queen Elizabeth an incredible woman in her first joint interview with Harry after their engagement announcement last month. Its incredible I think, to be able to meet her through his lens, not just with the honor and respect he has for her as the monarch but the love that he has for her as his grandmother, Markle said. All of those layers have been so important for me so that when I met her, I had such a deep understanding, and of course incredible respect, for being able to have that time with her.



The Sunday Times of London has reported the Queen will break royal convention and invite Markle to the entire threeday celebration at Sandringham.Neither Kate nor Mike Tindall, who married Zara Phillips, the Queens granddaughter and Princess Annes daughter, were invited when they were engaged but not yet married at Christmas. Kate spent Christmas with her family in Bucklebury, Berkshire, before she married William.

On Christmas Day, the royal family make the 300yard walk to St. Mary Magdalene Church, where Princess Charlotte was christened in 2015. The small stone church dating back to the 16th century sees Queen Elizabeth every Sunday when shes in residence at Sandringham. Prince Philip typically takes the brisk walk with the rest of the members of the royal family while the Queen arrives in her chauffeured car from Sandringham.



Also on Christmas Eve, some members of the royal family take part in an annual festive soccer match with workers and locals in the area. William and Harry usually play on opposite teams. They did not join in last year, but Harry and James Middleton, Kates brother, joined for the game at Castle Rising on a pitch near Lord Grenville Howards 12thcentury estate. Kates brother filled in for William, who had injured his ankle.
