 Content preview:    Hello Pamela, If you need to bring on people who have a
    very specific skillset, I have a unique process that finds and engages the
    most qualified for not much more than a posting. What most companies need
    is inquiries from highly qualified people about their position, so over the
    last 13 years I’ve built a system that helps you do high end hiring with
   minimal outlay. Send me a description of your job opportunity and I'll be
   happy to show you some of the best people out there.The end result of the
   service is highly qualified candidates who want to talk to you about your
   opportunity.  [...]

 reason the recruitment industry is the first to recover is because it is =
=0D=0Aa very competitive market and many businesses research and develop in=
 less =0D=0Abusy periods. Historically, the recruitment sector was always a=
bout who you =0D=0Aknew and the strength of your contact book. All of that =
changed with the arrival =0D=0Aof the web and the successful recruitment fi=
rms are the ones which adapted =0D=0Ato this.=0D=0A=0D=0AMany people believ=
ed that the sector would fall away due to the internet. Online =0D=0Ajob po=
rtals were seen as a threat to recruiters, but in reality they have made =
=0D=0Athe hiring process a lot more efficient. I am a firm believer in embr=
acing =0D=0Achange rather than fearing it, and the best companies will alwa=
ys look to evolve.=0D=0A=0D=0ATechnology refuses to stand still for anyone =
and we are now looking at a move =0D=0Aaway from PCs and laptops to a world=
 where people are in constant contact through =0D=0Amobile devices. Mobile =
phones currently account for over 17% of global internet =0D=0Ausage, and t=
his is growing sharply each year.=0D=0A=0D=0AThe pace of everyday life mean=
s that people want to be able to get as much =0D=0Adone as they can, and to=
day's smartphones allow for this to happen. From a =0D=0Arecruitment perspe=
ctive, hiring companies want to be able to screen people =0D=0Aalmost insta=
ntly, and candidates want to apply for jobs as easily as possible.=0D=0A=0D=
=0ALinkedIn, which is one of the biggest recruitment portals in the world, =
sees =0D=0A38% of its monthly visitors come through mobile phones, and this=
 is another =0D=0Aindication that the recruitment industry is getting smart=
er and ahead of the =0D=0Atrends. =0D=0A=0D=0AHowever, it is important to r=

in technology have been tremendous but at its heart, =0D=0Arecruitment alwa=
ys will be about people. Those who are able to build and maintain =0D=0Arel=
