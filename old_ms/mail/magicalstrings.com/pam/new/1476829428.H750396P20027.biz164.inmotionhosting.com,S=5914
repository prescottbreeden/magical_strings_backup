Dearest one in the Lord.

With Due Respect and Humanity, I was compelled to write to you under a humanitarian ground, however,this is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour against your will.

I'm Mrs. Meredith Gibbs native Filipina nationality. I am married to Mr. Gibbs Kouame, who worked with our Embassy in Accra, Ghana for nine years before he died in 2006. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.

Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home
which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $ 3.5 million from the bank in Koumasi,Ghana. 

Currently, this money is still in the custody of a bank in Koumasi,Ghana.Recently, my doctor told me that I would not last for the next eight months due to cancer problem. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church, organization or good person that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here.

I want the church, organization or good person that will use this fund for orphanages, widows and other people that need help, as well
as spreading the word of God, and try to get the house of God remains.The Bible made us to understand that "Blessed is the hand of the 
giver." l took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians 
not even good at all, because the one who is responsible for the death of my husband in other to have all my late husband and properties I do not want my husband's efforts to be used by those that conspired for his death.

That is why I am taking this decision, I am not afraid of death hence I know where I'm going. I know I'm going to be in the bosom of Lord.Exodus 14 and 14 states that "The Lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace." I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence , the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I do not want them to know about this development and I know that with God all things are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank in Koumasi,Ghana. I also give authorization to the bank that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money. I also want you, church or the organization to always pray for me because the Lord is my only Shepard.

My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Who wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and in truth. Please always be prayerful all your life.Contact me at this email address and any delay in your reply will give me room in searching for another good person, church, organization for this same purpose.

Hoping to get your answer immediately.

Thanks and remain blessed in the Lord.

l remain yours sister in Christ.

Mrs. Meredith Gibbs.
