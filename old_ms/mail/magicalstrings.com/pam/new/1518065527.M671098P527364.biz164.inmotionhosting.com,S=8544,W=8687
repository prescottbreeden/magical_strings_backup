<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>Sequel to a brief meeting held with the Vice President and board directors of the Central Bank of Nigeria,I was made to understand that you have not yet receive your fund which was long ago instructed to deliver to you by the Federal Government of this country.However I want to inform you that the following persons are the problem behind your payment and you must have nothing to do with them or their agents who pretends they have fund for you.</FONT></DIV>

<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>These people were reported as the cause of your payment delay and the matter is presently in the court here in Nigeria over stealing,forgery and embezzlement of beneficiaries fund.over twenty(20) of them were arrested last week and few were granted bail from Police Custody by Human right activist while some will be taking to court this week for prosecution and after that,those found guilty will be jailed for the illegal act towards your payment.Therefore you must discontinue further communication with any one here in Nigeria or Abroad not recommended to you by this honorable court as such communication is at your own risk.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>However It has been resolved that all beneficiaries whose contracts/inheritance funds have not been paid should now have a cause to smile.In the meeting, it was concluded that the concerned beneficiaries should be paid their contracts/inheritance funds without them (beneficiaries) paying any TRANSFER charges or DELIVERY CHARGE before they can receive such funds but only Administrative confirmation fee you the bonafide beneficiary will pay to this honorable court for execution order.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>As a result of this, only Administrative confirmation fee you the bonafide beneficiary will pay to this honorable court for execution order and no charges/fees shall be paid by any beneficiary concerned to the paying bank or courier company as all the fees will be deducted from the principal fund. In view of this, you are to forward all your account details for proper reconfirmation with the ones in our possession before the payment will be made to such a beneficiary.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
