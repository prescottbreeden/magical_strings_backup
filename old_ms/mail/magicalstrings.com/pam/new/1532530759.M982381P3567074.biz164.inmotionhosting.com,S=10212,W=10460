Granted all may not fit you or your travel plans, but I guarantee at least a handful of these gems can help you to maintain your zen, your waistline, and your energy while out of your normal routine. 1. Bring a refillable water bottle I use the Hydration Vessel. I bring it to the airport empty, and fill it after I pass through the security check-point. Make sure to refill often.
Plan for it. Set the alarm. Go to bed an hour earlier. Even if you can&#39;t go to sleep earlier, get up and get that workout in. You will feel much better in the long run if you do. It will help you burn those extra calories all throughout the day. 7. Make an effort to be active In addition to the workout, keep your activity up all day long. If you are eating more, move more. Its just that simple. Depending on your location, try some of the following:



Some might point out that having a to-do list allows us to get imporant things done efficiently, which frees us up for other important things like spending time with family, time for ourselves, etc. But I wonder does it really? Or could it just continue to strengthen a way of thinking that promotes getting more and more and more things done in a day?
