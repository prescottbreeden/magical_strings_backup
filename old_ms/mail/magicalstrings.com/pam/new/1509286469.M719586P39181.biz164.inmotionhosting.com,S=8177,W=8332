than ever to steal from your company. Follow these security measures to
protect your information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Every day you hear about data breaches.
Stolen information causes irreparable harm to businesses and their clients.
No matter what size of business you have, you need to protect your
information and prevent data breaches before they even happen. Here are
some strategies proven to work that you can use to keep your files
safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Evaluate your security procedures
:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The first step involves looking at your
current security protocols. Layering your security capabilities is the best
approach, because hackers will have to infiltrate multiple safeguards
before accessing any sensitive data. Tools such as firewalls, encryption,
secure file sharing and antivirus software all protect sensitive data from
falling into the wrong hands. If your cloud-based data storage service
offers security tools, you should still configure your own safety measures.
Limit cloud access to employees and use an extra layer of protection, such
as multi-factor authentication (MFA) or single sign-on (SSO).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Always back up data frequently so that
when a violation occurs, your system restores quickly and easily with the
most current data. Also, conduct screening and background checks on new
hires and mandate security training. Make sure all virus scanning software
stays current, and delete any suspicious files at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Protect your cloud and data
:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">To develop a more comprehensive cloud
security strategy, consider using a cloud access security broker, or CASB.
These software platforms offer continuous visibility, data security,
monitoring and governance for all cloud-based file storage. The CASB data
protection feature uses machine learning and user behavior to discover
unauthorized users and events. The organization can then use the CASB to
respond in real time, preventing hackers from gaining access to sensitive
information. Take comfort in knowing that the software will block any
unauthorized access attempts to reach your data, even when you are not
watching the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Another crucial element of cloud
security is visibility. CASBs alleviate visibility issues by auditing a
company&rsquo;s cloud services and sanctioning useful products while
blocking risky ones. CASBs also provide data security capabilities such as
encryption and tokenization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Improper configuration and weak security
procedures are a growing cause of cloud data breaches. These types of leaks
are often overlooked because they usually occur because of insiders and
because companies assume the cloud service providers (CSPs) will protect
their data. In fact, based on the shared responsibility model, the user is
responsible for the security in the cloud, not the CSPs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Prevent this by enforcing strict
password policies and user access controls. Make sure your cloud data
storage is private and only available to required users. A CASB can also
help with this by monitoring and configuring your cloud services so that
security is maximized. This can be applied to large cloud platforms such as
AWS, Salesforce and Office 365.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Electronic information not stored in the
cloud is still at risk. An internal breach of security is the most
dangerous type of breach and the hardest to spot. The more layers of
security you can add, the more you can secure your data. As with cloud
technology, limit employee access with special codes and biometrics. Only
essential employees should have access to sensitive company
data.</span></p>
