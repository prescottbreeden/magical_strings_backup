    Back in November, Chappelle hosted the first postelection Saturday Night
   Live, and during his monologue, he suggested viewers be open-minded with President
    Trump after getting a few jokes in, of course.I didnt know that Donald Trump
    was going to win the election. I did suspect it. Seemed like Hillary was
   doing well in the polls and yet I know the whites. You guys arent as full
   of surprises as you used to be, he said during his monologue. America has
   done it. Weve actually elected an Internet troll as our president.Chappelle
    concluded his monologue with an anecdote about attending an event at the
   Obama White House that had many black guests.I saw how happy everybody was,
    these people who had been historically disenfranchised. And it made me feel
    hopeful. And it made me feel proud to be an American. And it made me very
    happy about the prospects of our country, he shared.Im wishing Donald Trump
    dludf, Chappelle concluded. And Im going to give him a changhce, and we,
   the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one too. Clearly,
    Chappelle is taking that olive branch back Tired of paying for entertainment?
