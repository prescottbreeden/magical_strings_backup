Greetings:Good Mornning.</DIV>

It is my profound pleasure to contact you regardless of the fact that we do not know each other in person. My decision to contact you is based on your renowned international reputation as attested in your profile. Please bear in mind that this mail and the classified information contained therein that I am about to share with you can either destroy me, ruin my professional career or make me depending on how you receive and take it. Please, I need you to read this mail attentively to know the reason and purpose why you receive the same. Kindly allow me to briefly introduce my person before I explain in details.</DIV>

<DIV>
I am Mr. Edward Appa, a Fund Manager with a reputable bank here in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire and I handle all our Investors capital Project Funds which enabled me to divert 1.2 Percent Investors Excess Return Capital Funds to our Magellan Trust Funds Account whereby anyone can be presented to claim the funds. On this note, a total sum of US$56M (Fifty Six Million United States Dollars) has been diverted representing the 1.2 Percent Excess Return Capital Funds from the Investor Capital Project Funds for 2015/2016. I need a reliable and trustworthy person that can work this deal out with me so that we can claim the funds as mentioned above. There is no risk attached and the funds in question can never be detected or traced. Our sharing ratio would be 50:50. If you are interested, please reply and send your direct telephone numbers to me for a smooth discussion of this transaction in further details.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
But if you are not interested or see this mail as a spam or hoax simply delete it and forget I ever contacted you. If after 72 hours I didn't hear from you I will assume you are not interested, and then I will proceed to look for someone else that might be interested to work with me. This is a clean and straight forward bank deal; it is safe and risk-free, as I have taken care of all necessary steps to ensure a hitch-free movement of funds to your designated bank account. I will await your urgent response to this mail.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Please kindly direct ALL your message to (edward-appa@hotmail.com) for easy communication.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Sincerely yours,</DIV>
