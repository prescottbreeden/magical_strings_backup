After the Qing conquest, maritime trade was banned under the Haijin doctrine. The Kangxi Emperor lifted the prohibition and allowed foreigners to enter Chinese ports in 1684. Qing authorities established the Canton System in 1757 to more strictly regulate trade, restricting non-Russian ships to the port of Canton. While European demand for Chinese commodities like tea, silk, and porcelain was high, Chinese interest in European manufactured goods was negligible. To counter this trade imbalance, the British sold large volumes of Indian opium to China. Faced with a drug crisis, Qing officials pursued ever more aggressive actions to halt the opium trade. The Daoguang Emperor rejected proposals to legalise and tax opium, and instead ordered Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu to eradicate the opium trade in 1839. The commissioner destroyed opium stockpiles and stopped all foreign trade, forcing a British military response and starting the First Opium War. The Qing initially conceded early in the war and ceded Hong Kong Island in the Convention of Chuenpi. However, both countries were dissatisfied and did not ratify this agreement. After over a year of further hostilities, Hong Kong Island was formally ceded to the United Kingdom under the Treaty of Nanking on 29 August 1842. Administrative infrastructure was very quickly built up by early 1842, but frequent piracy, endemic disease, and hostile Qing policies towards Hong Kong prevented the government from attracting merchants. The Taiping Rebellion improved the island&#39;s conditions, when many wealthier Chinese fled from the turbulent conditions of the mainland and settled in the colony. Further tensions between the British and Qing over the opium trade escalated into the Second Opium War. The defeated Qing were again forced to give up land, ceding Kowloon Peninsula and Stonecutter&#39;s Island in the Convention of Peking. By the end of this war, Hong Kong had morphed from a transient colonial outpost into a major entrept. Rapid economic improvement in the 1850s attracted foreign investment, as potential stakeholders became more confident in the future of the colony. The colony was expanded further in 1898, when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories. The University of Hong Kong was established in 1911 as the territory&#39;s first higher education institute. Kai Tak Airport entered operation in 1924 and the colony was able to avoid a prolonged economic downturn after the CantonHong Kong strike ended, which had lasted for more than a year from 1925 through 1926. At the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Governor Northcote declared Hong Kong a neutral zone to safeguard its status as a free port. The colonial government prepared for a possible attack by evacuating all British women and children in 1940. The Imperial Japanese Army attacked Hong Kong on 8 December 1941, on the same morning as attack on Pearl Harbor. The colony was occupied by Japan for almost four years, before Britain resumed control on 30 August 1945. Hong Kong&#39;s population recovered quickly after the war, as skilled Chinese migrants fled from the Chinese Civil War. Even more refugees crossed the border when the Communist Party took full control of mainland China in 1949. Hong Kong became the first of the Four Asian Tiger economies to industrialise in the 1950s. With a rapidly rising population, the colonial government started reforms to improve infrastructure and public services. The public housing estate programme, ICAC, and Mass Transit Railway were all established in the post-war decades to provide safer housing, a clean civil service, and more reliable transport. The territory&#39;s competitiveness in manufacturing gradually declined due to rising labour and property costs, but it made a successful transition to a services-based economy. By the early 1990s, Hong Kong had established itself as a global financial centre and shipping hub. As the end of the New Territories lease drew closer, the colony faced an uncertain future and Governor MacLehose raised the question of Hong Kong&#39;s status with Deng Xiaoping in 1979. Diplomatic negotiations with China resulted in the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984. The United Kingdom agreed to transfer the entire colony in 1997 and China would guarantee Hong Kong&#39;s economic and political systems for 50 years after the transfer. The impending retrocession triggered a wave of mass emigration, as residents feared an erosion of civil rights, the rule of law, and quality of life. Over half a million people in total left the territory during the peak migration period from 1987 until 1996. Hong Kong was transferred to China on 1 July 1997, afte
