Two Sundays ago, The Times introduced a sing feature in the Sunday Review that has naturalization raised a number of eyebrows: a regular wanted column that says something nice about President dinge Trump. The columnist, Michael Kinsley, most notably large of Crossfire fame, explained that The Times lowest was looking for a few positive words verify about the president, and were asking for hermes your help. Kinsley prompted readers to write fraction to somethingnice@nytimes.com, and noted: One good thing orr Trump has done for the country, Kinsley acclaim claimed in the debut column, has been deere to allow the average citizen a view gar straight into the presidents id, through his literature personal Twitter feed.

Others said the column fahrenheit gave the impression that the paper is graded cozying up to a president who has cavity called the press the enemy of the forensic American people. A Times spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades-Ha, white explained that currying favor with Trump is pediatrics far from the columns aim.

I cant tell neutral if the column is -in-cheek or a cradle serious effort to balance out the negative recommendation with a little positive. Right now, it force seems perched in the middle, precariously. I dexter think the readers weve heard from, and bag the discussion on media, raise good inflatable questions about why theres a platform dedicated recess to patting a president on the back. wharf One not nice thing that happened last ritual weekend was an oil spill in New soho Yorks East River after more than 30,000 suffering
