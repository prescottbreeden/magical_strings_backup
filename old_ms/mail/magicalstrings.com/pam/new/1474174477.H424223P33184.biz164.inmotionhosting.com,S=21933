Hello everyone,
Thank you for putting a schedule into place Bonnie and for your igniting sp=
arks, Esther.


Bonnie and I had talked about the possibility of doing two soul calendar ve=
rses, the 30th week and the week after.
Please, have a look at them, the change of mood is so interestingly reflect=
ed by the forms and colors. Would you be up for it?


Thank you all,


Andrea

It is my understanding that these folks are coming: Esther, Pam, Linda, Jen=

Also, please reply with any topics that should be added to the meeting.


Schedule:
10am Warm up

12:30 Lunch
1:00 Meeting (rehearsals for All Souls), costumes, Spring Plans, Olaf 2017)
2:00 Share group work and offer feedback.

Hi Bonnie,
I have just heard back from Linda who is interested in doing the verse. It'=
s possible that Pam may be as well, given here general interest in the vers=
es. We would still need another person if I am in it too.=20
However, mainly it's a question of being able to fit in the required practi=
ces. I am willing to try. We would have to start on September 22. Would the=
re be a space for us? Bright Water? SWS? Could we still meet together and t=
hen break out?
Thanks
Esther

I have just heard back from Linda who is interested in doing the verse. It'=
s possible that Pam may be as well, given here general interest in the vers=
es. We would still need another person if I am in it too. <BR>However, main=
ly it's a question of being able to fit in the required practices. I am wil=
ling to try. We would have to start on September 22. Would there be a space=
 for us? Bright Water? SWS? Could we still meet together and then break out=
