Hello my dears!
I am looking forward to our gathering on Sat. 24.
How about we each bring a brief " warm up " excercise as we did once
before. It seemed to work as an interesting medley that year.
And the verse; Calendar of the Soul no 30 , 4th week in October is
particularly beautiful I think.
I does require 4 people and a director. So far we are Pam , Linda and
myself who would commit to this. Can you others please look at it and see
if you could join for the All Soul's evening on October 28? Obviously, with
me only able to come on weekends.....but I would so love to do it.
Thanks and widespread hugs
Esther
