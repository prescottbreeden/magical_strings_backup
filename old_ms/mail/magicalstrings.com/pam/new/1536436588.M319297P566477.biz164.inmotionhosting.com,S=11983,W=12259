By Ernesto Londoo and Nicholas Casey, New York TimesThe Trump administration held meetings with rebellious military officers from Venezuela over the last year to discuss their plans to overthrow President Nicols Maduro, according to U.S. officials and a former Venezuelan military commander who participated in the talks. Establishing a clandestine channel with coup plotters in Venezuela was a big gamble for Washington, given its long history of covert intervention across Latin America. Many in the region still deeply resent the United States for backing previous rebellions, coups and plots in countries like Cuba, Nicaragua, Brazil and Chile, and for turning a blind eye to the abuses military regimes committed during the Cold War. The White House, which declined to answer detailed questions about the talks, said in a statement that it was important to engage in dialogue with all Venezuelans who demonstrate a desire for democracy in order to bring positive change to a country that has suffered so much under Maduro. But one of the Venezuelan military commanders involved in the talks was hardly an ideal figure to help restore democracy: He is on the U.S. governments own sanctions list of corrupt officials in Venezuela.
