Military publicly releases redesigned self-defense tool

by Terry Neiland  @MilitechNews
Wed, 02 Nov 2016
 A redesigned version of a popular self-defense tool has just been released. Known commonly as a tactical striker
<http://upword.ckik.stream/Jgchlhwtov/ocndt511nead/pI1XKKaDV9piYG-onDMB2CV1Vqs4QOjfbvHNzyrRRVw/gjPFQgdsDRnwtBYlRRQ0rF-WU88mtcLpr_32ovpwACjomkTt1j9qyhNKzEwVeE7X5NaDue4tvgYIeH_v5clOVenCDQR5hzIuq8G4DJAEm3A>, it's frequently carried in areas where most weapons are forbidden. As one expert said, ""My tactical striker goes on airplanes with me and it&#39;s even gone into the courthouse when I had to go take care of a ticket. It sits right in my front right pocket, and no one ever questions it.&quot;

According to reports, the real significance of the tactical striker is that you can take it out and carry it in your hand when you feel the need to
<http://upword.ckik.stream/Jgchlhwtov/ocndt511nead/pI1XKKaDV9piYG-onDMB2CV1Vqs4QOjfbvHNzyrRRVw/gjPFQgdsDRnwtBYlRRQ0rF-WU88mtcLpr_32ovpwACjomkTt1j9qyhNKzEwVeE7X5NaDue4tvgYIeH_v5clOVenCDQR5hzIuq8G4DJAEm3A>. In other words, if you&#39;re walking towards a group of people who are giving you an uncomfortable feeling, you obviously can&#39;t pull out your gun, and you can&#39;t open up your knife as if you&#39;re prepared to fight someone. But, you can take out your striker and hold it in your hand. That way if something did happen, you would be able to quickly react and defend yourself.

When asked which tactical striker
<http://upword.ckik.stream/Jgchlhwtov/ocndt511nead/pI1XKKaDV9piYG-onDMB2CV1Vqs4QOjfbvHNzyrRRVw/gjPFQgdsDRnwtBYlRRQ0rF-WU88mtcLpr_32ovpwACjomkTt1j9qyhNKzEwVeE7X5NaDue4tvgYIeH_v5clOVenCDQR5hzIuq8G4DJAEm3A> he recommends, he said, &quot;Most are fine, but you need the top of the striker to be flat because you want to hold it in the &#39;ice pick&#39; grip, which means you put your thumb on the cap for added support. Using the ice pick grip with the thumb on the top gives you superior striking power.&quot;
