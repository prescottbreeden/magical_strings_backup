 Content preview:  Dear ones, Happy beginning of Advent! As we look to the end
    of this year and the start of 2017, as Esther has reminded us, it would be
    great to solidify our plans for the coming Spring, and set rehearsal dates.
    Its going to be another quick run up to whatever we decide to do at the end
    of March. I think this sort of discussion would be very difficult over email.
    So I am proposing to host a tea at my place sometime between 12/26-1/2, since
    I don't have to work (hooray!). Please send me dates/times that do NOT work
    for you during this week. I hope we will have some overlap! Then I'll send
    out the date and time of the tea. Thanks everyone, and here's hoping! Warmly,
    Linda [...]
