Subject: ***SPAM*** CONFIDENTIAL COURIER PAYMENT

-- 
I am Richard Currier of the Debt Recovery committee (DRC). My
committee has the mandate to recover unpaid debts associated with
contracts, lottery fund, inheritance fund, loans and grants etc
ranging from $ 1M- $ 19.5m owed to various beneficiaries across the
globe (Asia, Europe, USA, Africa, and Australia) and submit the list
of the unpaid beneficiaries to the appointed official paying Banks for
immediate payment of the fund.

In the course of our investigation, your email address / particulars
were listed among the first fifteen yet to be paid hence this email.
However, we received a petition yesterday from one Mrs.Christina
Morgan that you are dead. According to her, you died in a plane crash
therefore that the fund be paid to her as the heir apparent. She has
submitted her Bank account with FNB for the transfer of the fund to
her.

To avoid undue delay or paying the fund to wrong beneficiary, I have
decided to contact you for confirmation. If I fail to hear from you
after 72 hours, it will be assumed the petition of Mrs. Morgan is true
and the fund will be paid to her without further delay.

Therefore, if you are still alive, reconfirm your particulars as
stated below and send immediately ,

1. Full Name: ____________________________
2. Address: ______________________________
3. Nationality: ____________ Sex___________
4. Date of Birth: ________
5. Occupation: ___________________________
6. Phone: _______ Fax: _____________________
7. State of Origin: _______ Country: _______

Yours Sincerely,
Mr.Richard Currier.
