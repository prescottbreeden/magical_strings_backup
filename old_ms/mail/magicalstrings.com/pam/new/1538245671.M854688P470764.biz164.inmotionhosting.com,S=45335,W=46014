**Dear Members of the Anthroposophical Society**

With this further letter at the beginning of the new working year, we
would like to address you directly as the Executive Council, and extend
a warm greeting from the Goetheanum to all the Members worldwide. 

'What are we building on?' is our motive for this year within the
context of our work with the Foundation Stone of the Anthroposophical
Society, laid by Rudolf Steiner in the heart's of human beings. We are
currently intensively pursuing the question of an inner ethos and its
expression in the current conditions of life within the society.

In July 2018, after clarifying and reorganising the situation at the
Goetheanum, we consciously decided that the four members of the
Executive Council would accept the challenge posed by the vote of the
Members at the AGM in March. We will only deal with questions of a
possible addition after the next General Assembly and an evaluation of
the experiences made. Many questions concerning the leadership of the
Goetheanum and World Society are regularly discussed and supported by
the larger committee of the Goetheanum Leadership. Speakers (chair
persons) of the Goetheanum Leadership for the coming working year are
Constanza Kaliks (for the Executive Council) and Stefan Hasler (for the
Section Leaders).

You recently received a summer letter from us, detailing the financial
situation of the Goetheanum ('Anthroposophy Worldwide' Nr. 9/2018). It
made the current situation clear. In this regard we are truly dependent
on your participation and active support for the work of the Arts and
the School of Spiritual Science in the spirit intended by Rudolf
Steiner. We are grateful for the first positive support and donations
which have reached the Goetheanum from members and friends. We very much
hope that this common stream can sustain the continued activities at the
Goetheanum in the coming year without demanding major cuts.

During the many travels of the Council members in the last months, in
each case by invitation, the great diversity with which an awareness of
the spirituality living in the world as a burning question, was
tangible. It was particularly evident in the encounters with members,
branches and institutions. The overall impression remains, that this
multiplicity of difference, has a unifying effect. 

On the basis of these experiences we, as the Executive Council, strive
to develop an attitude in the Anthroposophical Society that not only
tolerates these different forms of work and approaches to Anthroposophy,
but also affirms in them the living reality of spiritual life. Only then
can we be "an enquiring society of what is generally human" and
contribute to the essential questions of current civilization. What is
needed is the will to take an interest in these individual forms of
being and life, to recognize them in their diversity and thus to develop
an ethos of care for a humane life of soul.

Nurturing a personal contact to Members, Branches, Groups in the
professional fields, Country Representatives, General Secretaries and
Functionaries is a central task of the Executive Council, in order to
meet the concerns described. In some places this has already been
intensively developed, in others we look forward to taking it up anew. 

At the recent retreat of the Executive Council and at the meeting of
European General Secretaries and Country Representatives in Warsaw (PL),
we discussed, among other things, the question of how members could be
more involved in the decision-making processes of the worldwide Society.
The desire and necessity to take a step in this direction is timely and
significant. Justus Wittich and Gerald Häfner report on the various
possibilities which also touch on constitutional issues and which need
to be discussed and considered together in 'Anthroposophy Worldwide'.

Dear Members, we greatly appreciate your support, your interest and your
participation in what is happening at the Goetheanum: a School of
Spiritual Science, the home of Anthroposophy and the Arts, as well as a
place for international encounters. 

With kind regards,

Executive Board at the Goetheanum: 

**Justus Wittich, Joan Sleigh, Constanza Kaliks and Matthias Girke**

m>Dear Members of the Anthroposophical Society </em></p>=0A=0A<p>With this =
further letter at the beginning of the new working year, we would like to a=
ddress you directly as the Executive Council, and extend a warm greeting fr=
om the Goetheanum to all the Members worldwide. </p>=0A=0A<p>=E2=80=98What =
are we building on?' is our motive for this year within the context of our =
work with the Foundation Stone of the Anthroposophical Society, laid by Rud=
olf Steiner in the heart=E2=80=99s of human beings. We are currently intens=
ively pursuing the question of an inner ethos and its expression in the cur=
rent conditions of life within the society.</p>=0A=0A<p>In July 2018, after=
 clarifying and reorganising the situation at the Goetheanum, we consciousl=
y decided that the four members of the Executive Council would accept the c=
hallenge posed by the vote of the Members at the AGM in March. We will only=
 deal with questions of a possible addition after the next General Assembly=
 and an evaluation of the experiences made. Many questions concerning the l=
eadership of the Goetheanum and World Society are regularly discussed and s=
upported by the larger committee of the Goetheanum Leadership. Speakers (ch=
air persons) of the Goetheanum Leadership for the coming working year are C=
onstanza Kaliks (for the Executive Council) and Stefan Hasler (for the Sect=
ion Leaders).</p>=0A=0A<p>You recently received a summer letter from us, de=
tailing the financial situation of the Goetheanum ('Anthroposophy Worldwide=
' Nr. 9/2018). It made the current situation clear. In this regard we are t=
ruly dependent on your participation and active support for the work of the=
 Arts and the School of Spiritual Science in the spirit intended by Rudolf =
Steiner. We are grateful for the first positive support and donations which=
 have reached the Goetheanum from members and friends. We very much hope th=
at this common stream can sustain the continued activities at the Goetheanu=
m in the coming year without demanding major cuts.</p>=0A=0A<p>During the m=
any travels of the Council members in the last months, in each case by invi=
tation, the great diversity with which an awareness of the spirituality liv=
ing in the world as a burning question, was tangible. It was particularly e=
vident in the encounters with members, branches and institutions. The overa=
ll impression remains, that this multiplicity of difference, has a unifying=
 effect. </p>=0A=0A<p>On the basis of these experiences we, as the Executiv=
e Council, strive to develop an attitude in the Anthroposophical Society th=
at not only tolerates these different forms of work and approaches to Anthr=
oposophy, but also affirms in them the living reality of spiritual life. On=
ly then can we be "an enquiring society of what is generally human" and con=
tribute to the essential questions of current civilization. What is needed =
is the will to take an interest in these individual forms of being and life=
, to recognize them in their diversity and thus to develop an ethos of care=
 for a humane life of soul.</p>=0A=0A<p>Nurturing a personal contact to Mem=
bers, Branches, Groups in the professional fields, Country Representatives,=
 General Secretaries and Functionaries is a central task of the Executive C=
ouncil, in order to meet the concerns described. In some places this has al=
ready been intensively developed, in others we look forward to taking it up=
 anew. </p>=0A=0A<p>At the recent retreat of the Executive Council and at t=
he meeting of European General Secretaries and Country Representatives in W=
arsaw (PL), we discussed, among other things, the question of how members c=
ould be more involved in the decision-making processes of the worldwide Soc=
iety. The desire and necessity to take a step in this direction is timely a=
nd significant. Justus Wittich and Gerald H=C3=A4fner report on the various=
 possibilities which also touch on constitutional issues and which need to =
be discussed and considered together in 'Anthroposophy Worldwide'.<br /><br=
 />Dear Members, we greatly appreciate your support, your interest and your=
 participation in what is happening at the Goetheanum: a School of Spiritua=
l Science, the home of Anthroposophy and the Arts, as well as a place for i=
nternational encounters.=E2=80=82</p>=0A=0A<p>With kind regards,</p>=0A=0A<=

l for the first positive support and donations which have reached the Goeth=
eanum from members and friends. We very much hope that this common stream c=
an sustain the continued activities at the Goetheanum in the coming year wi=
thout demanding major cuts.</p>=0A=0A<p>During the many travels of the Coun=
cil members in the last months, in each case by invitation, the great diver=
sity with which an awareness of the spirituality living in the world as a b=
urning question, was tangible. It was particularly evident in the encounter=
s with members, branches and institutions. The overall impression remains, =
that this multiplicity of difference, has a unifying effect. </p>=0A=0A<p>O=
n the basis of these experiences we, as the Executive Council, strive to de=
velop an attitude in the Anthroposophical Society that not only tolerates t=
hese different forms of work and approaches to Anthroposophy, but also affi=
rms in them the living reality of spiritual life. Only then can we be "an e=
nquiring society of what is generally human" and contribute to the essentia=
l questions of current civilization. What is needed is the will to take an =
interest in these individual forms of being and life, to recognize them in =
their diversity and thus to develop an ethos of care for a humane life of s=
oul.</p>=0A=0A<p>Nurturing a personal contact to Members, Branches, Groups =
in the professional fields, Country Representatives, General Secretaries an=
d Functionaries is a central task of the Executive Council, in order to mee=
t the concerns described. In some places this has already been intensively =
developed, in others we look forward to taking it up anew. </p>=0A=0A<p>At =
the recent retreat of the Executive Council and at the meeting of European =
General Secretaries and Country Representatives in Warsaw (PL), we discusse=
d, among other things, the question of how members could be more involved i=
n the decision-making processes of the worldwide Society. The desire and ne=
cessity to take a step in this direction is timely and significant. Justus =
Wittich and Gerald H=C3=A4fner report on the various possibilities which al=
so touch on constitutional issues and which need to be discussed and consid=
ered together in 'Anthroposophy Worldwide'.<br /><br />Dear Members, we gre=
atly appreciate your support, your interest and your participation in what =
is happening at the Goetheanum: a School of Spiritual Science, the home of =
Anthroposophy and the Arts, as well as a place for international encounters=
