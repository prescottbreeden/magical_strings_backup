Hello Pamela,

If you want to get people who have all of the qualifications that you =
need, I can help you for less than the cost of two postings=2E

There are two steps to consistently interview great people -  building a =
database of resumes for people who live near your office who have the =
background and skills that you need.  The next step is giving them =
compelling reasons to be interested in your company and opportunity=2E

I search anywhere I need to on the Internet using a series of precisely =
written search strings, then carefully screen to make sure that anyone I =
send you has exactly the background and skill set that you need. I also =
look at any other factors that are important to you, like stability and =
industry background.=20

The result is recent, qualified resumes sent to you every week for five =
weeks as attachments to an e-mail, and a spreadsheet with their contact =
information. Hire as many people as you need to =96 795 for one position =
600 per for more than one.  I will also help you write very engaging and =
persuasive emails that will get talented people interested=2E

What does your schedule look like for a quick call to talk about what =
you're looking for?

I'd be happy to show you some excellent candidates=2E
