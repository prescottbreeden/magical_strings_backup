Hello Beloved,

I am Mrs. Sarah Reynolds, it's true we  do not known each other but My spi=

any area you have experience and expertise and to disburse 50=
% of the annual net profit on charity causes,
35% for expansion (or diversification) while 15% will be kept by you as co=
mpensation for your labor.

The disbursements should be made to charities such as orphanages, motherle=

to understand more about the tragedy that took my late husband away from m=

 regain my self, as i am always from one sick bed to another, from one hos=
pital to another,  I will wait to hear from you if you can handle this tas=
k with honesty.

Reply me only on this email: charity@reynoldsgroups.com

Warm wishes from,
