We’re excited to announce that Flickr has agreed to be
acquired by SmugMug, the photography platform dedicated to
visual storytellers.

SmugMug has a long history of empowering people who love
photography and who want to improve their craft, making them
a perfect fit for Flickr and our creative community. With
SmugMug, we’ll continue to focus on you, the Flickr
members who inspire us all with your work.

Nothing will change immediately with regard to your Flickr
account. You will still access Flickr with your current
login credentials and you will have the same Flickr
experience as you do now. We will continue to work to make
your Flickr experience even better.

We think you are going to love Flickr under SmugMug
ownership, but you can choose to not have your Flickr
account and data transferred to SmugMug until May 16, 2018.
If you want to keep your Flickr account and data from being
transferred, you must go to your Flickr account to download
the photos and videos you want to keep, then delete your
account from your Account Settings by May 16, 2018.

If you do not delete your account by May 19, 2018, your
Flickr account and data will transfer to SmugMug and will be
governed by SmugMug’s Terms and Privacy Policy.

Read more detailed FAQs about this transition on the Flickr
Blog.

We’re happy that Flickr is your home for photography and
we look forward to the next chapter in our adventure
together as we join the SmugMug family.

Thanks, The Flickr Team
