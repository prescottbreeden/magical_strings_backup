 Content preview:  Hi sweetie, Hope you are doing ok! I'm not coming up with
   a lot of folks to put on a potential sponsor list, except Richard. (Richard
    Blackmore, richard.s.blackmore@gmail.com). Wondering if it might work to
   reach out to the Waldorf Schools to advertise in the program. You've given
    them lots of free advertising in the past. I bet they could do it - they
   likely have an advertising budget, esp. SWS and BWS. Wonder if Central Coop,
    or Essential Bakery or Terrys Berries would also buy ads? Ads are easier
   for folks to swallow than sponsorships, though I assume you will offer your
    501c3 if folks want the tax credit. Wonder also if folks would be interested
    in sponsoring a tune? $1000 for Philip to compose a new tune for the performance?
    "Sponsors reel"? ;) or they could have it named after someone?? Just some
    ideas for now. I'll keep thinking... Much love, Linda [...]
