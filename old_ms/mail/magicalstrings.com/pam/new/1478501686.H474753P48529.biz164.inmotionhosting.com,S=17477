Doctors Discover Method for Controlling Diabetes without Medicationby Lucy Umbrose  @HealthMatters
Fri, 05 Nov 2016
 To manage diabetes well
<http://zarr.kettei.stream/nxwbito/cgio1049rodvdbc/_COLQKMUYQ8BcbgjsjKpckCt1gxsOegopyNfmeR8PA4/N-_bvzjHVAMd-ir_N1sCnakHDBO8HZJQ-TyO44D3AWR6z9s8Wja2C0MRHumZMnK80mXuUYW1ZGQoFx6_Mz7VDZ5IXXzwoRhBOPmCheRVQ3zFCy1NNG5yOV9pMovccQ67> means keeping your blood sugar level down in the same range as that of people who don't have diabetes. The way we check this level is the A1C (sometimes called glycated hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c). This test tells you what your average blood sugar level was during the previous two or three months by using a drop of blood about as small as that you use on your regular fingerstick tests that tells you what your level is right then.

When you manage your diabetes well, it is well controlled. It is normal. We know that the normal A1C level is 6.0 or below. See ""The Normal A1C Level.&quot;

You can use drugs to bring your A1C level down to normal. That&#39;s a good thing. But this strategy does have its costs, and those costs aren&#39;t just money out of your pocket or your checkbook. The worst of those costs are the potential side effects of the drugs.

The good news is that diabetics can learn how to control diabetes without medication by making a few lifestyle changes
