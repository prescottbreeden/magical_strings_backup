It will enable us to leverage assets and capabilities ultimately driving further value for the CoderDojo Community, CoderDojo said in a statement.The two charities are retaining their respective identities, but will cooperate on a shared mission to teach more s aged seven to years how to code and make things, including apps, websites, and ggets. CoderDojo was launched in Cork, Ireland, in by Irish entrepreneur James Whelton and Australian entrepreneur Bill Liao. The pair of programmers wanted to create a place where s can learn from mentors how to bring their ideas to life with code.
