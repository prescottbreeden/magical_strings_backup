 Content preview:  Dear one, You and Philip have outdone yourselves again! Such
    a wonderful show!! I love the new tunes! And of course Haydn and Rowan are
    remarkable. 3rd grade parents were talking about how talented you all were,
    playing so many instruments, and all so well. Lots of folks downstairs afterwards
    talking about how much they enjoyed it. :) Hope you will get a bit of a break
    before the next show!! Thank you for sharing your beautiful music with all
    of us! Much love to you, and enjoy being with your lovely family! Ps, you
    were right. Last year I was in Cincinnati at my friends birthday / new house
    party, with Syd. I guess the last time I was there didn't seem so long ago.
    ;) [...]
