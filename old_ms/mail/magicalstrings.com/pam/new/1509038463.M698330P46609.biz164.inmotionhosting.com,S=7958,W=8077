 Content preview:  Hello, I am a 68-year-old woman and my home country is Bahrain,
    but I live in Ivory Coast (West Africa) for 30 years. I'm married without
    no children and we have never adopted a child until my husband died in a
   car accident, meanwhile my late husband is engaged in the export of cocoa
   beans from Côte d'Ivoire to any part of Europe.i know this proposal is definitely
    a surprise to you, but I apologize for taking the time to Review my messages
    carefully, because the decision will go far to determine my wishes. Now,
   I'm suffering from cancer and after much treatment, there is no improvement
    and damage much that I only have 10% of surviving any cancer surgery and
   my latest medical results show that I can only live on Earth for a few months.
    Meanwhile, I acquired USD 3.5 million and the fund is currently in the bank's
    vault and that's why I came into contact with you. To use this fund in your
    country to run a charity project that will bear my late Husband's name. I
    decided to follow my late husband’s step and desire to help the less privileged
    orphanages, even due he died without accomplished his dreams. My late husband’s
    brothers have plundered all properties and wealth except the fund in the
   bank which i refused to disclose to them. I found your Internet e-mail and
    I have done the prayers to the almighty god before contacting you. If you
    can be willing and interested to deal with these trust funds in good faith
    please answer immediately. Greetings from Mrs. Naheen [...]
