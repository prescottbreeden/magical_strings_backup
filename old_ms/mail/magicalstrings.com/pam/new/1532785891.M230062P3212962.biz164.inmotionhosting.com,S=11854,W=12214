The recording offers the public a glimpse at the confidfdential discussions between Trump and Cohen, and it confirms the man who now occupies the Oval Office had contemporaneous knowledge of a proposal to budy the rights to the story of Karen McDougal, a woman who has alleged she had an extramarital affair with Trump about a decade ago. Cohen told Trump about his plans to set up a company and finance the purchadse of the rights from American Media, which publishes the National Enquirer. The recording captures what appears to be a routine business conversation of several matters on their agenda. The audio is muddled and the meaning of Trump's use of the word ""cafsh&quot; is disputed by the two sides. &quot;I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David,&quot; Cohen said in the recording, likely a reference to American Media head David dPedcker. When financing comes up again later in the conversation, Trump interrupts Cohen asking, &quot;What financing?&quot; according to the recording. When Cohen tells Trump, &quot;We&#39;ll have to pay,&quot; Trump is heard saying &quot;pay with cdash&quot; but the audio is muddled and it&#39;s unclear whether he suggests paying with cafsh or not paying. Cohen says, &quot;no, no&quot; but it is not clear what is said next. No payment was ever made from Trump, Rudy Giuliani, the President&#39;s attorney, has said. Giuliani has previously acknowledged that the recorded discussion related to the budfying the story rights.
