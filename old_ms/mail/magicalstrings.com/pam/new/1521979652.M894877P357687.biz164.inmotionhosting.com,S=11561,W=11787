Pam,

 I'm reaching out today because I have a few questions about Magical String=
s. It may lead to a great working partnership. My company, Amerifi, is focu=
sed on helping businesses in the United States flourish with fast approvals=
 and working capital delivered on your schedule and terms.

 Many funding companies claim to have the best rates and approval history, =
but I'm here with decades of experience partnering with hard-working busine=
ss owners and I'll let them do the talking. Please read from our portfolio =
of testimonials.

 If you need a strategic funding partner who can respond quickly and also c=
reate a path to accomplish long-term goals, it might be wise for both of us=
 to give this some thought and gather a bit more information.

 Your company has intrigued me - let me know if I can pass over more detail=
s about mine.=C2=A0

 Thanks again,
 Edward
