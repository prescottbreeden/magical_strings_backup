Comment:   
I use tools to enhance erection rarely, maybe someone will tell. The first time I bought Viagra from a drugstore, and when taking action started after 25-30 minutes. Then mates advised to buy kamagra on this site <a href=https://shoping-card.com>https://shoping-card.com</a> buy. I bought at this site, but the effect was much faster than about 10-15 minutes. What is the cause, and if it does not affect my sexual organ, or is it okay, it may be that they are different, so to speak, the power? Thanks in advance for your reply. In both cases, the body present a small amount of spirit.
