Comment: Smoothing Average is a client side VTL Expert Adviser.  
The EA is based on one moving average and the entry and exit levels are determined by a Smoothing factor.  
Smoothing factor is a percentage of current price, when price is above the moving average by the smoothing factor, buy position is opened.  
When price is below the moving average by smoothing factor, sell position is opened.  
The EA has the ability to apply a stop loss and take profit also on positions opened.
