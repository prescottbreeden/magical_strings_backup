Comment: Hi There,  
  
My first thread on this forum and I thought I'd talk about starting out in Forex.  
I remember when I first started out.  
It's very exciting and there are many ways of making extra income with Forex trading.  
My only problem when I started out was the amount of sales clutter on the net.  
There are too many people out there, trying to part newbies with their hard earned cash, in exchange for a Forex bot, or magic formula system.  
They misguide people with sales tactics and cover the truth with persuasive language.  
This is why I started my own site which helps people get on the right track in Forex.  
I'm always transparent with the methods I use.  
I don't promote unrealistic approaches and I simply give newbies and novice traders real honest methods of trading.  
I don't intend to be promoting my site endlessly on Forums such as this.  
But being my first thread, I thought I'd tell people what I do etc.  
I enjoy Forex and if learnt properly it can provide an income stream for life.  
It's never smooth, there are always peaks and dips but it's an exciting career nonetheless.  
I encourage anybody struggling to find their way to visit my site and request the free resources available.  
I really enjoy hearing back from people as I like to feel like I did help them along the journey to success.  
Anyway that is my brief introduction.  
If you are SERIOUS about Forex trading, then at least make your first steps in the RIGHT direction.
