              <p><strong>News from Magic Hill &ndash; November 2008 </strong></p>
              <p>The life of Magical Strings and family continues to be full  of joy.&nbsp; Our most exciting news came just  before our departure for our annual East Coast Spring tour.&nbsp; Haydn Patrick was born to Brenin and Sara and  we were able to hold him, sing to him and compose a lullaby on the harp which  will be debuted at our 30 Annual Yuletide Concert.&nbsp; At seven months, Haydn is already showing a  predilection toward dance and joviality; not surprising since his mother is  leader of the Raney Irish dancers, and his sister Rowan has already won many  dancing awards.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Our entire family will be returning home for the final  weekend of Yuletide.&nbsp; &nbsp;Brenin, the cellist, who lives here in the  Northwest will be performing at all of our concerts, so you might catch a  glimpse of his little Haydn while watching Rowan bring the stage to life with  her exquisite Irish dancing. Our daughter Brittany, who currently is in New York City playing her violin day and night all over  the Eastern territories, will be flying home just in time for the Tacoma, Seattle  and Mt Vernon shows. She has been informed that if she doesn&rsquo;t play a solo at  this year&rsquo;s Yuletide, there might be rioting in the hall. &nbsp;Geoffrey who lives in Rhode Island will be bringing his whole family  home for the concerts and the Christmas season. &nbsp;His darling little girls, Kailey and Lindsey  who graced the stage last year on violin and harp can be seen in this years  Yuletide photo. Lindsey is holding the little gnome and Kailey is standing  right next to Pam.&nbsp; &nbsp;Morgan and Marshall will also be flying in  from Philadelphia and Providence.&nbsp;  Marshall  has two little girls, whom you might only know by their lullabies, &ldquo;Margaret&rsquo;s  Arrival&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bridget&rsquo;s Lullaby&rdquo; (both appearing on Philip&rsquo;s solo Harp CD <em>Musings</em>). Suffice it to say that  everyone is doing exceedingly well, and we can hardly wait to have them all  home, where the celebration begins! </p>
              <p>This is our 30th year of playing together as a  family at Yuletide and we are going to celebrate!!!.&nbsp; To honor the occasion, Pam and I have put  together a 2-CD compilation of our favorite pieces from recordings dating back  to 1980 PDA (Pre Digital Age!) when we released our first, <em>Glass Horse</em>, on cassette only<em>.</em>&nbsp; Drawing from nine major recordings, several  of which are now out of print, <strong><em><a href="R-Dances&Dreams.html">Best of Magical  Strings &ndash; Dances and Dreams</a></em></strong> took a natural direction of  organization: CD-I will energize your day, and CD-II will bring restfulness to your  night.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re quite excited about it, and  know that you will enjoy it too!&nbsp; And  that is just the beginning of the celebration&mdash;for the rest, you will have to  come to Yuletide to experience for yourself!</p>
              <p>Amidst the music and the planning, I am still finishing  harps for my many wonderful students, and enjoying my teaching life immensely  as the School of Magical   Strings reaches out from Magic Hill to Bremerton  (Harrison Hospital)  and from Seattle to Bellevue.&nbsp;  Many people are discovering the simple yet profound joy that the harp  brings to players and listeners alike. &nbsp;We had one of our most successful Magic Hill Summer  Harp and Dulcimer Camps ever, and later in the summer children were building  fairy houses and dancing about Magic Hill at Fairy School  with Pam&rsquo;s singing, painting and playing the lyre in our studio.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pam continues  teaching the lyre on instruments designed and built in our studio, to children  at the Bright Water  School (the Waldorf  School on Capitol Hill where I now  hold my Seattle  harp classes.) Pam also is quite committed to her practicing of the movement art  of eurythmy. Last May after our annual East Coast performing tour she spent a  month at Spring Valley Eurythmy in New York then  traveled on to Charleston to see our Brittany perform as  violin soloist at Spoleto Festival USA. In the month before Yuletide Brittany  will be performing Vivaldi&rsquo;s Four Seasons as soloist with the New Haven Symphony,  one of the many orchestras of whom she is a member. We can&rsquo;t wait for you to  hear her play her solo this year at Yuletide! </p>
              <p>Our joy reaches out to all of you with hopes that you will  celebrate with us this upcoming Yuletide Season&mdash;keep in touch, and keep the  light burning brightly!</p>

              <p><strong>Yuletide 2006 Greeting <br>
              </strong></p>
              <p>What is  Celtic Yuletide?&nbsp; It's a festival of light, a celebration of family and  tradition, a gala that weaves together music and dance, singing, story-telling  and juggling into an unforgettable experience of holiday joy. &nbsp; As our family  has grown, so has the community of musicians, artists, and fans with which we  are proud to be associated.&nbsp; They have all become part of our family, and  we invite you to join us as well for this our 28th annual Celtic  Yuletide Concert series.&nbsp; What better way to celebrate the light  overcoming darkness, when our thoughts turn to peace on earth, than to revel in  the harmonies of angels! </p>
              <p>&nbsp; Three generations of  families and artist will come together this year, making our Celtic Yuletide  Concerts more spectacular than ever. &nbsp; Enjoy the sounds of the seven-plus  member Boulding family, who bring you Celtic harps, hammered dulcimers,  violins, cello, whistles and concertina.&nbsp; Joining us will be the Raney  family Irish dancers, led by our daughter-in-law Sara; look especially for Sara  and Brenin&rsquo;s &quot;little tornado,&quot; seven-year-old Rowan, who will light  up the dance floor in full Irish regalia.&nbsp; Also part of the concert series  will be lyrical juggler extraordinaire Thomas Arthur and master Irish piper Tom  Creegan. &nbsp; New to this year's program is the dynamic Scottish music band  <a href="http://www.themckassons.com/" target="_blank">The McKassons</a>, comprised of Ryan McKasson on fiddle and his sister Cali  McKasson on piano, along with Ryan's wife Brooke on vocals and brother-in-law  Matt Jerrell on percussion. &nbsp; In the final weekend of concerts, Brittany will return  home to offer a soaring violin solo along with her lively Irish fiddling, and  the classic Celtic tale of St. Bridget will be accompanied by eurythmy and  harp.&nbsp; And because we consider you, our audience, as part of our family,  we wish to involve you in the fun with an opportunity to don a costume and  dance through the Great Hall as in the days of old. &nbsp; Rounding out our  group of gifted artists, Mark Raney will lead us all in songs of the season,  closing with a rousing rendition of &quot;All Through the Night.&quot; </p>
              <p>The Yuletide season is an  opportunity to reflect on the blessings of the past, attend to the needs of  those around us, and envision a better world to come.&nbsp; Please join us this  year as we celebrate this time of renewal, reconciliation, and goodwill to all!  &nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Update Brief on the Boulding family&mdash;</strong><br>
                Starting with our youngest:&nbsp;  Brittany our star violinist, at 24 is in Los Angeles  finishing up her graduate studies at Colburn Conservatory after performing at  the Tanglewood Music Center  all summer. &nbsp;Among the highlights were her performances of a beautiful  Brahms Sonata, and quartets of Mozart and Shostakovich at the Seiji Ozawa Hall,  sitting as assistant concertmaster with the Boston Symphony in a concert under  the direction of John Williams, having some moments with <br>
                Yo-Yo Ma, and studying with the  brilliant violinist Pamela Frank.&nbsp; Following those two months in western Massachusetts, she gave a stunning recital in Maine where we were all  witness to her maturing artistry.&nbsp; Our whole family gathered for a reunion  on Penobscot Bay where we sailed, swam in crystal  clear lakes, spent a glorious few days on a light house island composing music  by day and reading poetry at night. . . . . .&nbsp; Joining us in Maine were Marshall  and Abby &nbsp;with their two  darling daughters, seven-month-old Bridget and expert sandcastle builder  two-and-a -half year old Margaret.&nbsp; While visiting them on our spring tour  last April, we were inspired to compose a lullaby for little Bridget, to be  debuted at this year&rsquo;s Yuletide!&nbsp; That same journey also took us to Philadelphia for a&nbsp;visit  with our son Morgan and his wife Lara, who spends long hours buried in medical  studies.&nbsp; They both graced us with a lovely visit to Magic Hill this  summer while she fulfilled her first residency/rotation with doctors in the  Northwest.&nbsp; Brenin, our cellist, continues to spend long hours at the  Raney family chemistry lab in Seattle  with his wife Sara, leader of the Raney Irish Dancers.&nbsp; Their little Rowan  can hardly wait to be performing on stage at this year&rsquo;s Yuletide season, she  has become quite the dancer and is already competing at Northwest Irish Dance  Feis.&nbsp; Our eldest, Geoffrey, who joined  us in Maine this summer for our family&rsquo;s reunion, is enjoying his new position  at Brown University in Providence, immersed in electron-microscopy, while his  wife Erin keeps busy as director of collections for Johnson and Wales  University&rsquo;s culinary museum.&nbsp; They recently bought a charming house near  the river and park, where six-year-old Kailey and one-and-a-half-year-old  Lindsey can walk and play.&nbsp; It is a special bonus for us that we can visit  two families and 4 of our 5 granddaughters within 20 minutes of each other  while on spring tour!</p>
              
                <p>It gives us great joy to see our children working creatively  in the world, and bringing up beautiful children who will no doubt tackle a  very challenging world in the future (it&rsquo;s beginning to look like the  Matriarchy is due to take over&hellip;)&nbsp; <span class="right_image"><img src="Images/hawaii_harp_sm.jpg" alt="Magical Strings harp on Maui" width="250" height="188"></span>As for  Pam and Philip, we have been enjoying our creative life here on Magic  Hill.&nbsp; We often manage to slip away,  however,&nbsp; and it was last February that  we found ourselves on a beautiful tour in Maui, giving workshops, school  programs, and concerts culminating at one of our favorite spots&mdash;the quaint  little St. John&rsquo;s
                  church in Kula, on the mountainside of the great Haleakala  with an unforgettable view over this tropical island paradise!&nbsp; Imagine listening to Philip&rsquo;s newly composed  slack-key style lullaby on Celtic harp, &lsquo;Ohana Kai&rsquo;, while the sun is setting  over the world with a slowly changing panorama of spectacular colors&hellip; you&rsquo;re  all invited next time, with plenty of Aloha to go around!&nbsp; 
                  </p>
              
                <p>Meanwhile, Philip has been enjoying his work in the shop  building and designing harps (look for the new &ldquo;mid-size Oladion&rdquo;, a portable  4-octave range from low G with the sound of a concert harp!), while Pam has  been spending time in Portland for intensive weekends of eurythmy training as  well as another year of teaching lyre to children at the Bright Water Waldorf  School in Seattle.&nbsp; &nbsp;This August we hosted our 6th  annual Summer Harp Camp here on Magic Hill to a marvelous group of students  from all over the Northwest and beyond (including California  and Colorado).&nbsp; At the close of the summer Pam and I took a  sojourn to the Olympic Peninsula and the wilds of the Washington Coast,  camping, writing, and taking in the elements to rejuvenate us before the onset  of our fall schedule of teaching, harp-making, and Yuletide preparations. We  continue to enjoy making music together &mdash;especially our spring tour&rsquo;s  grand-finale of a standing-room-only concert at the Kennedy Center  on the Millennium Stage!&nbsp; Coincidentally,  the McKassons also had a debut on the same stage this past year&mdash;our paths have  just been waiting to cross!&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Now we are preparing for the culmination of our year&mdash;the  pooling, condensing, collaborating and synthesizing of many talents and  experiences into the blazing festival of Yuletide!&nbsp; It has been a special treat to work with the  McKasssons, and we&rsquo;re getting into high gear for a rollicking 28th  season!</p>
              <p>*Read on below for more news and history on the Boulding  family written January of 2006.</p>
              <p><strong>Epiphany 2006&mdash;Reflections from Magic Hill</strong></p>
              <p>On  this sixth day of January we celebrate the Kings&rsquo; visit to the Christ-child. It  is the time when we reflect upon the festival of Christmas, our Celtic Yuletide  journey and the year past before we look to what our tasks are for the  future.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>It has been a  year of abundant grace for us.&nbsp; Nearly  everyone was home for the final weekend of our 27th Annual Celtic  Yuletide Concert season, with the exception of Marshall and Abby.&nbsp; They are awaiting the arrival of two-year-old  Margaret&rsquo;s first sibling. In preparation for this mid-January event, Marshall, who manages his own business designing and building  homes, is putting the finishing touches on a beautiful new &ldquo;spa/bathroom&rdquo; for  their little farmhouse in Warren,   Rhode Island. Abby, in her third  year of teaching fourth grade, is hoping to continue working right up until  delivery.</p>
              <p>It was at this  very same time last January that Geoffrey and Erin gave birth to their second  child, Lindsey Gwen. With always a smile upon her face she brings much  happiness to the whole family, especially to 5-year-old Kailey. &ldquo;Grandmommy&rdquo;  swiftly made her way to Lansing,   Michigan to sing lullabies to  granddaughter number four.&nbsp;&nbsp; Philip had  to postpone his meeting with Lindsey until the spring as he was headed for  Oregon to record two double-CD albums of solo harp and solo hammered dulcimer (available  on our website: www.magicalstrings.com.) </p>
              <p>Both Pam and  Philip resumed their teaching schedules, Pam with lyre classes at the Bright Water  Waldorf School  in Seattle and Philip with harp classes at our  own School of Magical Strings  in Seattle and Olalla. Along with local Magical Strings  performances, we began an extensive school tour lasting until early March. We  presented assemblies and workshops for over 5,000 children, giving a hands-on  experience with our own hand made harps and dulcimers while treating the  students to some of our favorite Celtic and original music and  stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a month afterwards we were flooded with heart-warming  letters from hundreds of children.&nbsp; One  second-grader handed us a note: &ldquo;Thank you so much. Now I&rsquo;ve found what I have  been missing in my life &mdash;music!&nbsp; I want  to learn to play the harp, and when I do, I will make it rock!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;A  teacher shared with us that for this little girl, school and family life were  very difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Our spring  performing tour began in Virginia  on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ndash; the earliest ever.&nbsp;  The tour included workshops and a concert at the Upper Potomac Dulcimer  Festival in scenic Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, West Virginia,  then a full circuit from Virginia to New Hampshire and  back.&nbsp; We managed to fit in wonderful  visits with family and dear friends: a little &ldquo;side-trip&rdquo; to Lansing  for Easter with Geoffrey and family, precious moments with Philip&rsquo;s mother  outside of Boston and on Cape Cod, a few days  with Marshall and family in Rhode   Island and finally a brief stay in Philadelphia with Morgan and Lara.&nbsp; Morgan is currently working for a small  high-end construction company as foreman and master of many tasks while his  wife Lara pursues her second year at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic  Medicine.&nbsp; They both keep incredibly busy  schedules but find time to go birding, run a few side businesses and jet off to  Iceland  on a study break!&nbsp;&nbsp; Our East Coast tour  came to a beautiful close with almost all of our family coming together to  celebrate the Christening of the youngest, Lindsey at the Virginia home of her  other grandparents, the Marvins.</p>
              <p>Upon returning  home, Philip went back into the studio to record another 2-CD set of Christmas  music for solo harp while Pam&rsquo;s niece Phoebe joined the family for a visit and  began working in the Magical Strings  office.&nbsp; June found us off and traveling  again.&nbsp; First to San Diego to welcome little Sevilla into the  world, born to our niece Carew and her husband Aaron.&nbsp; We love Carew like a daughter.&nbsp; (She came to live with us one year when she  was in high school and later attended UW in Seattle.) Then we traveled straight away to  Breckenridge Colorado,  where our darling daughter and concert violinist Brittany was in residence with  the National Repertory Orchestra.&nbsp; The  highlight of the summer and perhaps even the year was to experience Brittany&rsquo;s spectacular solo performance of Samuel  Barber&rsquo;s Violin Concerto with the NRO under the baton of guest conductor Larry  Rachleff (Music Director for the Shepherd School Symphony at Rice University  &ndash; Brittany&rsquo;s  Alma Mater.)&nbsp; Philip, with an early  birthday present in hand, was able to capture the performance on video! <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                We made it  back to Olalla just in time to welcome Marshall,  Abby and nineteen-month-old Margaret for her first adventure on Magic  Hill.&nbsp; With visits to the zoo, ferry boat  rides and a picnic in the pasture with friends and family we are hoping that  she will want to return every summer to be with her &ldquo;Mamala and Papa.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The rest of  the summer included Pam&rsquo;s teaching painting and music to children in our studio,  a week-long eurythmy workshop in Portland, Philip&rsquo;s building and displaying of  fine harps and dulcimers at Northwest art fairs, festival performances and our  hosting the 6th Annual Magic Hill Summer Harp and Dulcimer  Camp.&nbsp; Philip built nearly twenty harps  and sold most of them before the weekend was over.&nbsp; Pam and Philip taught dulcimer and harp while  Brenin, Sara and Rowan cooked and served gourmet vegan meals for fifty  people&mdash;it was our best summer camp yet! </p>
              <p>Harp  camp was followed with a lovely visit from our dear friend Virginia Peterson  who at 84 was just beginning to walk again after an accident on a ship the year  before.&nbsp; Soon she will be travelling the  world on another ship!&nbsp; Pam&rsquo;s older  sister, Peggy traveled from Maine  to join us for Wagner&rsquo;s Ring cycle&mdash;a deeply edifying experience and an  unforgettable and loving time together for sisters. Brittany  returned for a brief visit just in time to join us for two of the operas before  returning to her second year of graduate studies at the Colburn Conservatory in  Los Angeles, where she was among a few students  worldwide accepted to study with Robert Lipsett after her graduation from Rice University&rsquo;s  Shepherd School of Music in 2004.</p>
              <p>Philip and  Pam&rsquo;s wonderfully long summer came to a close with a weekend sailing cruise to  the San Juan Islands.&nbsp; The winds were gusting at 35 knots, we were  fully reefed and Pam was thrilled to be at the helm.&nbsp; Our friend, the skipper and boat builder, was  explaining to Philip that the line across the water far off in the distance was  a convergence, where winds moving in two different directions come up against  one-another.&nbsp; &ldquo;So, if we sailed to that  line,&rdquo; Philip asked, &ldquo;and I took out my harp and began to play, we would have a  harmonic convergence?&rdquo;&nbsp; Without missing a  beat, his 10-year-old daughter replied, &ldquo;No, we would have a Philharmonic  convergence.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>In late  September we found ourselves once again on the road, this time heading south  for a West Coast performing tour.&nbsp; Our  Bay area concerts were scheduled at just the right time! We were able to  celebrate with Brittany  after she won her first symphony audition.&nbsp;  She is now a first violinist in the Oakland East Bay Symphony the under  the direction of Michael Morgan.&nbsp; In Los Angeles a few days later Brittany  was able to join us on stage for our grand-finale concert just before she  departed for Houston  where she gave a stunning solo recital. </p>
              <p>Philip drove  home from LA to prepare for his full registration of fall harp classes, while  Pam flew directly to Providence  to spend precious time with the three East Coast granddaughters and to visit  Geoffrey in his new office!&nbsp; In August  Geoffrey moved his family from Lansing Michigan, to Providence Rhode Island where he, in keeping with his talents,  accepted a position managing the Bio-imaging facility of the Biology and  Medical Division at Brown   University. Erin has just  accepted a position as the Collections Manager for Johnson and Wales University&rsquo;s  Culinary Archives and Museum in Providence.&nbsp; Kailey and Lindsey love living near their  cousin Margaret and making frequents visit to the farm only twenty minutes  away.</p>
              <p>Finally back at Magic Hill, we both began preparing  for our Yuletide concert season. Yuletide could not be possible were it not for  Brenin, Sara, and 5-year-old Rowan. We feel so fortunate that they live close  by in Seattle  where they work together managing the Raney family chemistry lab. Brenin plays  a major cello-role with Magical Strings  throughout the year, while Sara leads her sisters as the Raney Irish dancers at  all of our concerts, and teaches and runs the Tara Academy of Irish Dance. In  the midst of all this they are also homeschooling Rowan, even &ldquo;Grandmama&rdquo; has  enjoyed participating with storytelling, singing, lyre playing and painting.  This year at Yuletide Rowan danced a fancy reel to Philip&rsquo;s new toy-accordion  piece!&nbsp; He has taken up this tiny  instrument as a light-hearted balance to his 30 years of harp playing, quoting  the Gary Larson cartoon:&nbsp; &ldquo;Welcome to  heaven, here&rsquo;s your harp/ Welcome to hell, here&rsquo;s your accordion!&rdquo; <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
                Many of the  concerts were sold out, and the little cousins had endless fun playing with  one-another. Lindsey made her Yuletide debut, in full Irish costume, clanging  away on the glockenspiel for the opening &ldquo;Love Came Down at Christmas,&rdquo; and with  her aunt, uncle and parents played a star role as the babe in our story about  kings and shepherds.&nbsp; Brittany commanded instant standing ovations  for her solo violin performances of Ravels electrifying &ldquo;Tzigane.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the audience began to settle down Philip  remarked &ldquo;Did we really give birth to this child?&rdquo; to which Pam quickly replied  &ldquo;No, my dearest&mdash;I did!&rdquo; More than a few tears were shed during the  harp/cello/violin trio on &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; in contrast to the lively Irish dances  and processional that had the entire audience clapping along.&nbsp; Philip&rsquo;s mother Elise, at 85, can no longer  travel to these as events as she used to in earlier days with Kenneth, but has  been kept in close touch from her place at North Hill.&nbsp; Philip asked if she had a message for our  audiences. She replied: &ldquo;We all need to find peace within ourselves in our  daily lives, and then figure out how to connect that with all those around us,  and to the world.&rdquo; </p>
              <p>Christmas was  celebrated with almost everyone home; the New Year was approached in prayerful  silence with family and friends, and then greeted joyfully outside with the  ringing of bells and gongs.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the  winds and rains fill these Northwest winter days, we anticipate with  determination the challenge of the year to come, and look forward to the warmth  and light returning to our earth and to seeing many of you, our dear family and  friends, again. </p>
