              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica">With dancing hammers and pulsating strings, Philip  and Pam Boulding create the  distinctive music of <strong>Magical Strings</strong>,  described by The Washington Post as &quot;warm, graceful and sonically  gorgeous.&quot; Celtic harps and  hammered dulcimers are colorfully augmented by pennywhistles, concertina,  valiha (Malagasy harp) and storytelling. Since 1978 they have drawn a loyal following worldwide, captivated by  their energetic arrangements of Celtic music and their own engaging  compositions, intertwining Celtic roots with classical and world music  influences.              <IMG SRC="Images/PamPhilip.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=142 BORDER=0 ALT="Pam & Philip Boulding" align=right>

              <font size=2 face="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"><p>Practically a household name in the Northwest, <strong>Magical</strong> <strong>Strings</strong> has toured throughout the United   States, Canada,  and Ireland.  In Japan  they toured twice (&rsquo;97 and &rsquo;99) with their family quartet, including Brittany  and Brenin on violin and cello, performing many sold-out concerts from Okinawa  to Sapporo.  As a duo Philip and Pam opened for Dan  Fogelberg in 30 major U.S.  cities, sharing their music with enthusiastic crowds of up to 15,000 a night.  Following the tour they were invited to record with him on <em>River of Souls</em> and then a second album, <em>The First Christmas  Morning.</em>
              <p>Since  1980 <strong>Magical</strong> <strong>Strings</strong> has recorded 18 albums on Flying Fish/Rounder, EarthBeat  Records, and their own label, Magic Hill Music. Their more recent CD featuring  the family quartet, <strong><em><a href="R-WDD.html">Where Dragons Dance</a></em></strong><em>,</em> appears  on Allegro&rsquo;s <em>Alula Visions</em> label. Their three newest releases  appear on their own label: <a href="R-Dances&Dreams.html"><strong><em>Dances  and Dreams - Best of Magical Strings</em></strong></a>, which celebrates 30 years of  their career featuring their favorite tracks from the first nine albums; <strong><em><a href="R-Musings.html">Musings</a></em></strong>,  a solo harp all-original album from Philip; and <strong><em><a href="R-Celtic_Yuletide.html">Celtic Yuletide Live!</a></em></strong>,  featuring energetic live performances from their 2009 Yuletide season. Their  music has received a growing stream of international airplay and acclaim over  the years. <strong><em><a href="R-IslandsCalling.html">Islands Calling</a>,</em></strong> wasnamed &quot;their best album yet&quot; by Billboard  Magazine in 1996, and features several guest artists including Alex de Grassi  and Hawaiian slack-key virtuoso Keola Beamer.
              <p>Philip  and Pam have performed on radio and television networks around the country,  including &lsquo;A Prairie Home Companion,&rsquo; NPR's Weekend Edition, CNN both at home  and in Europe, and prime time TV in Japan. They placed first at the Grannard  bicentennial harp festival competition in Ireland  in 1981; have collaborated with Northwest ballet and theatre companies, and  performed for Russia&rsquo;s Boris  Yeltsin when he visited Seattle.  They were awarded a residency by the Cill Rialaig Irish arts organization in  Co. Kerry, Ireland  for a summer of inspiration in an historic cottage overlooking the western sea,  where they composed much of the material for their most recent recordings.
              <p> The Bouldings run the well-known <strong><a href="SchoolIndex.html">School</a></strong> <a href="SchoolIndex.html"><strong>of</strong> <strong>Magical</strong> <strong>Strings</strong></a>, inspiring students of the  Celtic harp and hammered dulcimer since 1978. They design and manufacture  instruments for an international clientele (over 2,600 built to date) and  continue to host the annual <strong><a href="HarpCamp.html">Magic Hill  Summer Harp Camp</a></strong> on their property. Philip and Pam love to share their  music with children and have performed in schools throughout the country,  including Waldorf schools where for over 30 years they have taught harp, lyre,  painting, and orchestra classes. Once referred to by the local media as the  &quot;Von Trapp Family of the Northwest&quot;, their love of music is embraced  by their 5 children and 6 grandchildren, many of whom still join them from  across the country to perform their annual Celtic Yuletide Concerts along with  Irish dancers and a host of guest artists in concert halls throughout the  region. Their youngest, violinist  daughter Brittany, currently resides in Seattle with  her husband and performs with Seattle Symphony, PNB, and as concert master for both  the Auburn symphony and the 5th Avenue Theatre.
<p> Philip and Pam continue to have boundless energy for their  creative life, which is nurtured by their home on a beautiful 5 acres they call  Magic Hill, overlooking the Puget Sound.                             </font> </td>
