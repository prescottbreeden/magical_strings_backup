              <p><strong>Reflections  for Website Newsletter update &ndash; April, 2016</strong><br>
As we prepare to embark upon our 37th annual  east coast spring tour, we wanted to share with you some reflections from our  travels and updates about our musical family over the last two years.</p>
              <p><br>
                We had a very special Celtic Yuletide season 2015 with  sold out shows and lots of new music inspired by our recent adventures in  Ireland.&nbsp; A grand addition to our tour  line-up was Brittany&rsquo;s husband Prescott, a former opera singer with a resonant  baritone voice, taking the place of our singer Colleen who was herself off on  hiatus in Ireland.&nbsp; Many thanks to all  who attended, and joined in the festive singing and processional!&nbsp; January 2016 found me right back in the shop  again with a nice back-log of harp orders.&nbsp;  Ah, good to be making sawdust again, in the solitude of my harp-making  hermitage in the woods.&nbsp; It has always  been a good balance for me, to have seasons of music-making interspersed with  seasons of harp-making and teaching.<br>
                We have been to Ireland twice recently, in 2014 and 2015,  both times in September with glorious weather, journeys to the magnificent  Skellig Michael and other sacred and ancient monuments; amazing pictures (see  our slide show on the <a href="http://www.magicalstrings.com/tours/index.html">home page)</a>, new friendships and experiences, a  traditional music festival in Dingle, loads of musical inspiration, and finally  our discovery of a magical island in southwest Co Cork, Cape Clear.&nbsp; More reflections to follow.<br>
                Our most recent journey to Ireland reminded us how  important it is for us to connect with that ancient landscape along with its  profound culture past and present, with a future one can only imagine.&nbsp; Following our 2014 trip, I composed a harp  piece called &ldquo;The Hermit&rsquo;s Cave&rdquo; &ndash; &nbsp;</p>
              <p><em>We began our adventures on  the Burren, a mystical limestone landscape spanning 160 square miles in Co.  Clare, filled with ancient stone dolmens and structures, some dating back 5,000  years.&nbsp; We were sent by our host on a  mission to find the cave of a 6th century hermit, St. Colman  McDuach.&nbsp; Back in the early days of a  blossoming Celtic Christianity, he was sent by St. Enda of Aranmore to do seven  years penance on the Burren. &nbsp;Several  colorful legends surround this character; suffice it to say that after much  hiking and searching, we found his small cave on a mountainside, concealed by a  grove of hazelnut trees.&nbsp; Just big enough  for one person, I sat inside for some time in silence, trying to imagine such  an austere life, so long ago&hellip; my mind wandered to a metaphor about the cave  from esoteric literature, in which the pupil enters to plumb the depths of  inner life, experiences a near-death like sleep while absorbing wisdom among  the stars, and emerges in the daylight &lsquo;reborn&rsquo;.&nbsp; With my small harp there in Ireland, I began  this musical meditation on the hermit&rsquo;s cave&hellip; yet a work in progress.</em><br>
                Here  is a snippet of my journal from that same trip in 2014:<br>
  <em>The next day involved much driving, first through the  Burren to re-visit the prehistoric Polnabrone Dolmen, a massive &ldquo;wedge tomb&rdquo; we  initially discovered over 30 years ago.&nbsp;  Back then it was a hike across a grassy field from a narrow winding road,  with nothing but a small marker on the road indicating its presence.&nbsp; Now it has become a major tourist attraction  with a big parking lot and rangers attending, and the dolmen itself is roped  off to keep people away&hellip; alas, the price and problem of popularity and  preservation!&nbsp; The energy is still there,  but seemingly more deeply hidden, while tourists mulled about.&nbsp; As the ranger described to us the problems  with vandals and careless people, along with excavations by archeologists, it  was a wonder to me that the monument still stood after some 5,000 years.&nbsp; I remember feeling a deep sense of  disappointment, almost sacrilege, as he described how a crane was used to  temporarily remove the multi-ton cap-stone in order to enable excavations.&nbsp; As he began to describe theories about how  the ancient builders would have moved and placed such a cap-stone in the first  place, using logs and a gradual incline, a part of my mind said &lsquo;no&mdash;that long  ago, people had a different way of moving very heavy&nbsp; objects, using a certain mastery of  nature-life forces now lost to us&hellip;&rsquo;</em></p>
              <p>During that 2014 trip we  discovered the island of Cape Clear on the very southwest tip of Ireland, Co.  Cork, well below the Skelligs.&nbsp; You get  to it via ferry from Baltimore, a small town that abounds in colorful  historical tales of pirates and political intrigue.&nbsp; Here we made friends with the folks who run  Fastnet House B&amp;B, which is next door to the 13th century Dun na  Sead castle built by an Anglo-Norman lord in in 1215, which became the historical  home of the O&rsquo;Driscoll clan.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>A year later, 2015, Pam and I  did a concert in that castle, and felt like bards of old.&nbsp; The next morning early we ferried out to Cape  Clear and spent three magical days walking, playing music, and meeting  fascinating people from writers to an international peace youth group called  &ldquo;Building Walls, Tearing Down Walls&rdquo; whose members come from opposite sides of  strife-torn countries to work together and learn from each other.&nbsp; In this case, they were re-building some of  the fallen stone walls of a pig farmer; so they learn the ancient art of dry-stone  masonry as well!&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Of the ancient sites on Cape  Clear, most striking to me were the &ldquo;marriage stones&rdquo;, called so in more recent  times because it became a place where local couples would declare their love by  touching hands through a carved portal in one of the stones.&nbsp; These imposing monoliths stand about  eight-nine feet tall, and are thought to have been the center of a large stone  circle at one time.&nbsp; When I first saw  them, I immediately felt the presence of something ancient and powerful, echoes  of the Hibernian mysteries.&nbsp; Undoubtedly  these were built by Druids and arranged for solar alignments with the summer or  winter solstice.&nbsp; Below is a poem I wrote  for our Celtic Yuletide program:</p>
              <p><strong>Cape Clear</strong><br>
                We walked hilly lanes through gorse and through heather,<br>
                Like raiment of purple and gold;<br>
                Windy bluffs and sea arches, and two standing stones,<br>
                Silent monuments from mysteries of old-<br>
                Thus Hu and Ceridwen stood watch o&rsquo;er creation<br>
                From ancient realms so it seemed;<br>
                Guardians of secrets through light and darkness,<br>
                Toward a future world redeemed&hellip;<br>
                The Druids and Bards foretold of a time<br>
                When the Sun King would come to earth,<br>
                To walk among men and show a new way;<br>
                And the solstice would herald His birth!</p>
              <p>Being on Cape Clear feels  something like being in the arms of a loving mother, even though she can be  stern at times!&nbsp; Here is an excerpt from  Pam&rsquo;s journal:<br>
                <em>We&rsquo;re on Cape Clear sitting in Cotters Pub  beside a warming peat fire after our early evening walk on the western side of  the island with a brief visit to Lough Errul, when the silvery sky lit up the  hills, lough, heather and gorse. The sun was finally beginning to show itself  after a day of drenching rain which had made it seem as if we were swimming  though the country side, wading streams that had been trails the day before and  soaking Philip to the bone.&nbsp; Philip had  given me all his warm and water repellant gear (to protect books, camera and  binoculars and help to warm me up) and as I followed up and down the long  walk/run back to our B&amp;B I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. What a sight he was.  What a day we&rsquo;d had. (This inspired a new lively dulcimer composition from  Philip called &ldquo;Caught in the Rain&rdquo;, played at Yuletide with grandson Haydn on  percussion)</em><br>
                <em>I&rsquo;m feeling so gloriously peaceful, serene,  deep and purely perfect inner happiness --- just the two of us, together by a  peat fire, writing in complete harmony, as enlivened and inspired and dreamy  and relaxed as two can be ---here on Cape Clear with a pint for Philip and a  glass of Guinness for me and the windy seascape beyond the window carrying away  all worries, all obligations, all responsibilities -- just being, BEING, here  on Cape Clear -- our Island of peace. I want to return always and forever.</em><br>
                I will close for now with some thoughts on Skellig  Michael.&nbsp; It is interesting that both  journeys to this magnificent monastic island in 2014 and 2015 coincided closely  the Star Wars filming for the most recent movie, and presumably its  sequel.&nbsp; It created quite a stir and  controversy in Ireland between the progressive &lsquo;economic benefit&rsquo; side and the  conservative &lsquo;don&rsquo;t defile this sacred monument&rsquo; side, toward the latter of which  we tended, I must confess. &nbsp;More, we were  afraid that such a world-wide exposure would bring massive crowds flocking to  visit, to the detriment of this holy isle.&nbsp;  One the other hand, I reminded myself, the very reason monks came out in  their leather boats initially 1,500 years ago was for its sheer isolation and inaccessibility.&nbsp; To this day, no one can get to Skellig but by  small fishing boat, and only on the calmest of days, lest you get dashed  against the rock face.&nbsp; Pam and I were utterly  blessed with good timing for our last three visits (2009, 2014, and 2015) &ndash; in  each case access had been denied for months due to bad weather, and we arrived  on the first good day; then access was denied again after our departure, either  due to bad weather, Star Wars filming, or (in 2009) someone falling to their  death due to vertigo on the precarious stone steps leading up to the  monastery.&nbsp; <br>
                </p>
              <p>I feel at times like my life is a book of destiny, which  story is not only unfinished, but never-ending&hellip; occasionally I turn a page, the  clouds part, the sun shines in illuminating a glorious landscape which I then  must put into music&hellip;<br>
              </p>
              <p>From Pam&rsquo;s journal:<br>
                <em>Our journey to Skellig, the crossing, the  anticipation, the exhilaration, then to touch those ancient sacred stones, to  climb each step carefully and consciously, feel the uniqueness of the  precariousness of life,&nbsp; so close to  those precipices. I want to retain the feeling that vibrated in my body and  that soothed my constantly busy thinking, planning, rushing&hellip;</em><br>
                <em>The stillness ~ sitting in that open monk&rsquo;s  cell, alone and pressed up against the stone cross. It had enwrapped my being  and I can feel and relive the experience, even today &hellip;so far away in time and  distance.</em><br>
              </p>
              <p>Here is a poem I wrote standing on the bluff near Slea Head  on the Dingle Peninsula overlooking the Blasket Islands; you could barely make  out the Skelligs in the south as the sun was setting over the sea:<br>
                Ireland-<br>
                Land of ancient stone and brilliant green,<br>
                Land of sweeping vastness, realm of Bards and Kings,<br>
                And warriors and shining ones of whom the poet sings-<br>
                Speak to me of the golden age of scholars and saints,<br>
                O land of blood, land of peace,<br>
                Land music where, lost and come again,<br>
                The harp still rings&hellip;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Other milestones of our family: <br>
                We are thrilled that our violinist daughter Brittany has received a  permanent position with Seattle Symphony. &nbsp;You can <a href="http://archives.warpradio.com/btr/wgcharchives/CenterStage/031516.mp3" target="_blank">listen</a> to a wonderful interview of  Brittany when she was in New York while she was there performing with members  PNB Ballet and Orchestra: <a href="http://archives.warpradio.com/btr/wgcharchives/CenterStage/031516.mp3">http://archives.warpradio.com/btr/wgcharchives/CenterStage/031516.mp3</a>.&nbsp; <br>
                </p>
              <p>Speaking of ballet, our granddaughter Rowan (15) just did a beautiful  performance with PNB in Seattle of a Pirate&rsquo;s Tale, Le Corsaire.<br>
                Morgan and Sylvia, now living only an hour away in Kingston, WA  (having moved from Philadelphia a few years ago) are creating quite the  homestead with chickens, rabbits, goats and turkeys, along with a successful  building and painting business, all of which keeps them busy day and night  (including occasional maintenance on our old house!) - How lucky for us to have  them so nearby!&nbsp; Now three of our five  live close to home, the other two (Marshall and eldest Geoffrey) are still in  Rhode Island within 20 minutes of each other, and two maturing granddaughters  each!&nbsp; Marshall has a successful building  business outside of Providence, while Geoffrey teaches electron microscopy at  Brown University.&nbsp; He takes his work to  an artistic level in his spare time, with what he calls &ldquo;Nanoscapes&rdquo; &ndash; see some  of them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Nanoscape-1398376263750333/" target="_blank">here</a>: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Nanoscape-1398376263750333/">https://www.facebook.com/Nanoscape-1398376263750333/</a> <br>
                </p>
              <p>Pam has just completed a beautiful tour with her troupe,  Eurythmy Northwest, performing in Waldorf schools throughout western  Washington. Pam played the role of Branch, a golden deer from a Jataka fairy tale,  along with choreography of piano music by Kodaly, Glinka, and Debussy.<br>
                </p>
              <p>Below are a couple of Christmas poems that sums up our  family at a glance, from December 2014 and 2015:</p>
              <p>We come to the close of 2015<br>
                With gratitude for the good year it has been.<br>
                The beautiful music of our Brittany<br>
                Brought her membership to THE Seattle Symphony,<br>
                While Prescott&rsquo;s hiatus from university<br>
                Graced ALL our concerts with vocal versatility.<br>
                Geoff, Erin, Kailey and Lindsey in Riverside stay,<br>
                Where NANOSCAPES, cycling, running, soccer and dancing hold  sway.<br>
                Marshall, Abby, Margaret and Bridget not far away<br>
                Are BUILDING and TEACHING; harp, violin and trumpet they  play.<br>
                Morgan and Sylvia with chickens, kittens and rabbits in  Kingston reside<br>
                Added sweet whistles and organ at EVERY Yuletide.<br>
  &lsquo;Cross the Sound, Brenin, Sara, Rowan and Haydn were all the  rage,<br>
                With cello, juggling, drumming and BRILLIANT Irish dancing  on stage!<br>
                Meanwhile Pam and Philip as is their wont<br>
                Went to IRELAND again for inspiration&rsquo;s fount.<br>
                With harp and dulcimer from Skellig to Cape Clear,<br>
                The Muse filled their well with ideas (and good beer!)<br>
                Returning with music and stories galore,<br>
                Into CELTIC YULETIDE it was all poured.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                Thus our 37th Season brought warmth and good cheer,<br>
              So Peace to you all and a Happy New Year!</p>
              <p><strong>Christmas 2014</strong><br>
                Within the deep-white pureness of snow<br>
                The day after our last Leavenworth show,<br>
                Appears a clean slate for the New Year to come<br>
                And a reflection of that year which has just been.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                From coast to coast and shore to shore,<br>
  &lsquo;Cross continents and oceans and islands galore<br>
                Our travels brought visions of a beautiful world<br>
                And the people therein, how their stories unfurled!<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                From Yuletide to Maui our music spread joy,<br>
                From Spring Tour to Alaska Cruise our strings were employed.<br>
                In Wyoming and Magic Hill Harp Camp students enjoyed<br>
                The making of music -&not;&not;- adults, girls and boys.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                A wedding in Florida brought four generations;<br>
                Pam&rsquo;s uncle in Jacksonville inspires veneration!<br>
                Philip&rsquo;s niece in St. Augustine made nuptial declarations,<br>
                Many families came together for much celebration!<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                The Maine island lighthouse was much the same thing,<br>
                Pam&rsquo;s sisters and aunt were like birds on the wing&hellip;<br>
                Charades in the night, and the laughter did ring<br>
                To Faraway, and sailing, all made our hearts sing.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                Then off to Ireland to find new inspiration;<br>
                An ancient Hermit&rsquo;s Cave to a new island sensation&hellip;<br>
                A return to the Skelligs, a grand recapitulation;<br>
                New music abounds, and still in creation&hellip;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                To our family and friends old and new please come nigh<br>
                And visit our home on the Sound by and by.<br>
                Magic Hill is ever our favorite place to be<br>
                And now new trails are being made to the sea!<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                So, gathering the clan &lsquo;round the hearth in the rain<br>
  &lsquo;Twas time to do good ol&rsquo; Yuletide again!<br>
                Our 36th Season brought many good cheer<br>
              So Peace to you all, and to all a Great Year !</p>
              <p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to  spring and summer &ndash; after our tour come festivals, the Celtic Cruise to Alaska  (#3!) in June, and our Magic Hill Summer Harp and Dulcimer Camp end of July-  see more info and links on our home page; and see more pictures on our Facebook  page: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MagicalStrings/">https://www.facebook.com/MagicalStrings/</a> <br>
  &nbsp;The end for now</p>
<p><strong>Magical  Strings and Boulding Family News &ndash; December 2011</strong><br>
                Did you  ever wonder how we came up with the name Magical Strings?&nbsp; It just came to me one day when riding a  ferry, shortly after meeting Pam, who was a dulcimer student in the class that  I was teaching at the Market   School. &nbsp;I also had begun building small harps and providing  them for the students in my harp classes.&nbsp;  It was definitely time to change the name of my business, Dulcimer Workshop.&nbsp; I wanted the new name to reflect the magic of  the music Pam and I were making together on harp and hammered dulcimer. We  started performing together almost immediately upon meeting, playing for  children in schools and at Seattle Children&rsquo;s Hospital as well as other venues  around town.&nbsp; As I stood on the bow of the  ferry, returning from a solo gig on Bainbridge   Island, the wind was  singing in my ears and I heard it: Magical Strings!</p>
              <p> That was more  than thirty three years ago.&nbsp; It takes  time to reflect on a third of a century, not to mention the three years it has  been since we posted a newsletter on our website.</p>
              <p><a href="Images/News_2011/wedding_party_LG.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="Images/News_2011/wedding_party.jpg" alt="Family wedding picture" width="350" height="232" align="right"></a> </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>2011 has  been a &lsquo;magical year&rsquo; with the highlight being Brittany&rsquo;s marriage to Prescott Breeden.&nbsp;  It was a glorious event taking place amongst tall firs beside the Hood Canal and  overlooking the Olympic Mountains on August  28, which turned out to be the most perfect day of the summer.&nbsp; All of our five children and six grandchildren  along with Philip&rsquo;s three brothers, Pam&rsquo;s three sisters, ours and Prescott&rsquo;s extended family, dear friends and  representatives of Brittany&rsquo;s  musical life gathered for a most joyous occasion to be remembered for all time.&nbsp; <a href="http://photoelan.com/Wedding_SlideShows/Brittany_and_Prescott/" target="_blank">Here is a slideshow from the wedding</a>.  </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>At a picnic on Magic Hill the day before, we  watched the children play croquet in the pasture,build  fairy houses in the woods and swing on the hammock while enjoying a feast  created by Brittany&rsquo;s  brothers. It was a full weekend of family and festivities, a year in the  making.<br>
                We took a  breather before jumping into our busy fall schedule of building instruments and  teaching, Philip at our School of Magical Strings both in our studio in Olalla and on  Capital Hill at the Bright   Water School  where Pam teaches lyre.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are thrilled now to have Brittany and  Prescott happily living in the Northwest, having been on the East Coast for a  number of years.&nbsp; They found a lovely  house near Lake Washington which they share  with their puppy Wotan, a very large and loving Leonberger. Prescott is  growing his business as a top notch dog trainer and animal behavior specialist,  while&nbsp; Brittany&nbsp;  performs&nbsp;frequently with the Seattle Symphony. &nbsp;She is also  Concertmaster of the Auburn Symphony, with whom she will be performing, as  soloist, the Shostakovich Violin Concerto on April 28 and 29 in 2012.&nbsp; She  has recently joined the Finisterra Trio, who will be offering some Piazzolla  for us at the Seattle Yuletide show on Saturday, December 17th.&nbsp; Brittany  is also Concertmaster for the&nbsp;5th&nbsp;Avenue&nbsp;Theater  production of Rogers and Hammerstein&rsquo;s Cinderella.&nbsp; This month when she is not at the 5th Ave,  you can find her in the pit at McCaw Hall with PNB&rsquo;s production of the  Nutcracker among other performances-- sixty shows in six weeks! We are lucky to  get her for Seattle&rsquo;s  Yuletide at Town Hall. What a treat it has been all year for us to come  into&nbsp;Seattle  from time to time, meet her for dinner and then see her on stage at Benaroya  Hall playing with the Seattle Symphony!</p>

He and his twin brother Morgan, both fiery red-heads, were born on Halloween 36  years ago (though they claim to be forever 27) and have been since birth an  endless source of creative mischief and merriment. Both are self-employed as  builders and designers&mdash;Morgan in Philadelphia  with his wife Lara (a doctor of osteopathic medicine)&mdash;and are much loved by  their employees, spreading joy to everyone they meet. Marshall&rsquo;s  wife Abigail is a wonderful 4/5 grade teacher at a school in Barrington, and recently added another master&rsquo;s  degree in mathematics to her own education in the midst of a busy family life  on a farm. We went trick-or-treating with eight year  old Margaret and five year old Bridget, and in the bitter cold watched them  play soccer early one morning.</p>

              <p>Geoffrey, our eldest, who also  lives in Rhode Island, teaches electron  microscopy and manages the bio-imaging facility at Brown University.  He has always claimed to combine art with science, and proved it this time with  a beautiful gallery showing of his electron microscope photography at Johnson  and Wales University's  Culinary Arts Museum,  where his wife Erin is the collections manager. &nbsp;He calls his images 'nanoscapes' and they are  truly awe-inspiring.  These microscopic &lsquo;landscapes&rsquo;  were created from everyday food items one would find in a kitchen!  <a href="http://nanoscape.tumblr.com/" title="blocked::http://nanoscape.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Here are  more.</a><br>

              <p>This  season both of their daughters are performing in a production of Nutcracker in Providence, so we&rsquo;ll miss  having them with us at Yuletide. Kailey, 11, has dreamed of having her own harp  and received, as a birthday present, a harp that Philip built for her. Before  returning home after the summer wedding, she had her first official harp lesson  and a second lesson during our visit this fall.&nbsp;  Bright spirited Lindsey at 6 is quite the soccer enthusiast, loves their  family dog and everything about life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

              <p><img src="Images/News_2011/Brenin and kids.jpg" alt="Brenin and kids" width="131" height="238" align="left">Dance is also a major focus for  Brenin&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; Here in Seattle  granddaughter Rowan (also 11 and only two months older than cousin Kailey) is  winning Irish dance competitions  along with studying ballet at Pacific Northwest Ballet School; she has performed  in their productions of Sleeping Beauty, Mid Summer Night&rsquo;s Dream, Cinderella and  will be cupid in the upcoming Don Quixote. Her father Brenin is busy keeping up  with all the dance schedules between daughter and wife Sara's Tara Academy of  Irish Dance and his own full time work at Holy  Names Academy  in Seattle. He  is our faithful cellist and juggler for Yuletide&mdash;he also happens to be our  chief cook for the Magic Hill Summer Harp Camp (link  to most recent page), creating legendary feasts that have become an  important draw for returning students!  Their family comes for the weekend to  the delight of all, and Rowan will usually teach some Irish dance steps around  the fire circle in the pasture at night.&nbsp;  Sara, along with her full time work in running a dance school, home-schools  Rowan and their son Haydn, who is becoming quite the dancer and percussionist  in his own right. On his third birthday last March, he received a little drum  kit, and proceeded to amaze us all with quite a sophisticated percussion  performance. This year <img src="Images/News_2011/Haydn playing the ukulele at Kent's Yuletide.jpg" alt="Haydn playing the ukulele at Kent's Yuletide" width="120" height="154" align="left">he has been seen playing the harp and ukulele on stage  at the Yuletide concerts.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>  It is always wonderful when Brenin, his family and  Brittany and Prescott join us on Magic Hill for a family gathering.&nbsp; How fortunate we are to have at least two of  our five children residing nearby.<br>

              <p>Magic  Hill with its ancient firs and maples standing on the bluff overlooking the Puget Sound is peaceful and in its resting time of year  as the Winter Solstice approaches.  After a day's work  in the shop Philip looks forward to taking our golden retriever, Sir Galahad, for  a walk down to the beach. Galahad loves to run up and down the long sandy  strand, grouse about in the trees and underbrush; and if he happens to spy seals  or otters out in the water, he will leap in and swim after them. He is a  creature of love. When we practice our harp and dulcimer in the living room, he  likes to be close by waiting for the moment when he can start singing sweetly  to the sounds of the accordion and concertina.<br>
                The same  beach below Magic Hill where we walk with Galahad everyday is where we  collected many colorful stones for Brittany&rsquo;s  wedding.&nbsp; The stones were beautifully  displayed in baskets and offered to the guests after the ceremony to take to  the waters edge and cast into the sea making a wish of happiness for the bridal  couple, an old Celtic tradition.<br>

              <p>Places  where the land meets the sea hold a special significance for us.&nbsp; After a busy schedule, we like to take  Galahad to Cannon   Beach for long walks on  the vast expanse of sand midst the grandeur of Haystack rock.  After  Yuletide we will make our annual retreat to the warm sands of Maui  for rejuvenation and tropical musical inspiration.<br>

              <p>Last spring  took us on our annual tour to the east coast, where we performed from New Hampshire to Maryland.&nbsp; It was a more sobering experience this time,  as there were to be no joyful visits with Philip&rsquo;s mother, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/us/02boulding.html" target="_blank">Elise Boulding</a> or with sister Christie who lived in the Boston  area.&nbsp; Both passed away within three  months of each other in June and September of 2010.&nbsp; In the spring of that year we had sat by Elise&rsquo;s  bedside as she joyfully listened to our music and stories.&nbsp; A tireless worker for world peace all her  life, she always claimed that we gave peace to the world through our music. She  never missed our annual concerts at the Peace Abbey in Sherborn; even within  months of her passing, when she was rarely able to leave the facility at North  Hill. She came and added brightness and joy with her great-granddaughters  surrounding her!&nbsp; It was a year of both  joy and sorrow, yet filled with reflection upon the preciousness of life.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Upon  returning home from our tour Pam returned to her lyre students at the Bright Water   Waldorf School  and prepared them for their end of the year performance.&nbsp; For the past few years she has joined the  troupe of Northwest eurythmists for performances of fairy tales which they take  on tour to all the Waldorf schools around the region. Last  spring she transformed herself into a Sacred White Cow from India for &ldquo;The  Boy with a Moon on his Forehead&rdquo;  Pam also manages to find time  once a week to visit Rowan and Haydn, and take our little prince for walks to  the park or the zoo.<br>
                This  Yuletide season, eurythmist and friend Bonnie Freundlich  is choreographing a solo work to one of Philip&rsquo;s earlier harp pieces called  &ldquo;The Stairs&rdquo;, a lively and mirthful composition inspired by a game our boys  used to play when they were young, which involved chasing each other up and  down the stairs until, inevitably, one of them would get hurt (they weren&rsquo;t  always the perfect angels you see today&hellip;).<br>

                It was an amazing journey with  our dear friends the Crowells from NJ, during which we composed two pieces, The Fairy Wind and Barbara&rsquo;s Cottage (these appear on our CD <a href="R-Celtic_Yuletide.html">Celtic Yuletide Live</a>, 2010).&nbsp;  We followed the footsteps of the 17th century Irish harper  Turlough O&rsquo;Carolan and saw his harp on display at the manor home of the  O&rsquo;Conors.&nbsp; Our trip culminated with a  fantastic excursion out to the Skellig Michael monastic island, a return from  our first visit 25 years earlier which inspired the CD Crossing to Skellig.&nbsp; Below  is a piece I wrote about that excursion, with my own personal reflections about  the lost hermitage on the north peak   of Skellig. Here are more <a href="Ireland_2009.html">photos from our trip</a>.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Meditation  on the Lost Hermitage</strong><br>
                When Pam and I recently traveled  to Skellig Michael, she had a transforming experience, while I experienced what  you might call an agonized disappointment.&nbsp;  Oh, not that the place didn&rsquo;t live up to it&rsquo;s image in my mind of  spiritual majesty and unbridled beauty; but rather, that I did not live up to  my own vow, after a thwarted attempt 25 years ago, to scale the south peak to  the &lsquo;lost hermitage&rsquo;.&nbsp; I have had dreams  about this place ever since I learned about it, as if I had been that hermit  long ago, longing to return to this very place that stands at the threshold  between heaven and earth.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t so  much the new fence with a warning sign saying &ldquo;Danger -- NO passage beyond this  point!&rdquo; that thwarted me, although it served as a lame excuse I suppose&hellip; but  rather, I was genuinely afraid to attempt this perilous and difficult ascent,  as I have heard it from various accounts.&nbsp;  My disappointment was only deepened when I heard from a fellow traveler  afterward that a couple did ascend the peak together in that same journey out  there&mdash;and described it as a &lsquo;difficult climb, only suitable for those with  rock-climbing skills&hellip;&rsquo; Well, I had those skills once upon a time back in my Colorado days, but  nevertheless&hellip;</p>
<p>It was interesting how, after our  return home, Pam released me from my &lsquo;obsession&rsquo;, by naming it for what it  was&mdash;an obsession.&nbsp; (It also helped, oddly  enough, when she told me, upon our descent from Skellig, that I may attempt the  climb to the hermitage only after, and if, she dies before I do&hellip;).&nbsp; So there it is.&nbsp; Two days after our journey to Skellig, a sad  and auspicious event took place; an American woman, probably the same age as  me, fell from Skellig and died&mdash;after which all journeys to the island were put  to a halt, for probably a year, for safety review.&nbsp; Another person had fallen to their death last  May.&nbsp; It is, in fact, a dizzying climb to  the summit, where an amazing 5th century enclave of beehive-shaped  huts, oratories and passage-ways, built stone upon layered stone, awaits the  striving pilgrim and casual tourist alike.&nbsp;  If one looks over the edge of this enclave, it inspires dizziness all  over again; not to mention awe for the harsh existence of the monks who built  this place, and lived and labored and prayed and sang here so many years ago. </p>
              <p>So here I am, back on Magic Hill,  surrounded by beauty, reflecting on the experience&mdash;not only of&nbsp; Skellig, but of Glendalough, where we visited  for the first time at the beginning of this trip to Ireland.&nbsp; There, the home of St. Kevin in the sixth century  is another hermitage one can view from across the lake: a cave thirty feet up a  solid rock cliff above the lake.&nbsp; What is  it about the idea of the hermitage that holds such intense interest for me?&nbsp; In my youth, I often wanted to be alone, but  it was a selfish desire that led to great depression for lack of  understanding.&nbsp; Then came my &lsquo;spiritual  conversion&rsquo;, for lack of better words, which was aided by my mother who was  well versed in various spiritual and religious traditions. She had even built  her own hermitage on the mountain side above our family cabin in Colorado, and spent a  year&rsquo;s sabbatical there. I became intensely interested in the life of St.  Francis, and the Desert Fathers before him who, as it turns out, inspired such  hermetic traditions in Ireland.&nbsp; What is the meaning of the hermitage?</p>
              <p>Obviously, it is a place of  solitude; inaccessible, where no one can interrupt one&rsquo;s meditation upon the  divine&mdash;where one can thoroughly separate oneself from the throng of humanity,  and seek the uniqueness of one&rsquo;s human-ness in relation to all that is.&nbsp; I came to realize that, for all these amazing  places, the hermitage of today lies not on mountain peaks or in desert caves,  but rather within the secret chamber of the heart.&nbsp; No one may enter accept by permission, and  this is only granted from one soul to another, in a most sublime covenant.&nbsp; The challenge for us now is to find a place  of quiet in today&rsquo;s noisy world, wherein we may enter that inner hermitage at  an appointed time, when we need to take refuge for reflection.&nbsp; Whether on Skellig, or in our own room, it is  not an easy place to attain&mdash;we confront many obstacles.&nbsp; But once there, we find a vista over the  world, and realize our place within the magnificent cathedral of humanity.<br>
