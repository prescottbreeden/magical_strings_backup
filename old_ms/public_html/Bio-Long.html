						<p>MAGICAL  STRINGS centers around the Celtic harp and hammered dulcimer of Philip and Pam  Boulding, at times augmented by violin, cello, pennywhistle, percussion and  various instruments from around the world. Over the years their sound has drawn  a large and loyal following captivated by a combination of traditional Celtic  arrangements, original compositions and subtle world music influences. Their  virtuosity and expressive style have been described as &quot;warm, graceful and  sonically gorgeous&quot; by the Washington Post. Their music and stories have  the effect of holding an audience and opening their hearts to a forgotten world  well-veiled by the bustle and trappings of modern life.                         
                        <p><IMG SRC="Images/PamPhilip.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=142 BORDER=0 ALT="Pam & Philip Boulding" align=right>Magical  Strings has toured nationwide and abroad since 1978. They have recorded eighteen  albums on four labels, including Flying Fish/Rounder Records, EarthBeat!  Records, Allegro, and their own label, Magic Hill Music. Their ninth, released  in July '96 on EarthBeat! Records titled <a href="http://www.magicalstrings.com/R-IslandsCalling.html">Islands Calling</a> features a collaboration of their family with fifteen guest artists (including  cellist Eugene Friesen, guitarist Alex di Grassi, and Hawaiian slack-key  virtuoso Keola Beamer) in a theme of island journeys reflecting their own world  travels, from Ireland to Jamaica, and Madagascar  to Hawaii.  The album is comprised mostly of original works with some pieces based upon  traditional ethnic melodies. Their 10th CD, <strong><em><a href="R-Legend.html">Legend of Inishcahey</a>, </em></strong>is  a return to Celtic roots featuring the family quartet with a special guest appearance  by cellist Eugene Friesen.<em> Legend of  Inishcahey</em> has been hailed by the leading English music magazine, <em>Folk Roots</em>, as &quot;...an exciting  cross-pollination of Irish/World sounds delivered with freshness, style and  panache... 'Legend of Inishcahey' is musical manna from heaven.&rdquo;                         
<p>Pam Boulding performs on hammered dulcimer, and  Philip Boulding plays Celtic harp (both nylon and wire strung), hammered  dulcimer, tin whistle, button accordion, and valiha (a bamboo harp from Madagascar).  Philip also designs and builds the harps and dulcimers, and has handcrafted  more than 2,500 instruments since 1971. In addition to the unique sound of  Philip's instruments, he also has developed some unusual techniques including  innovative harmonics and a stunning vibrato effect on the steel-strung harp. He  is known for his expressive power and dynamic pulsating rhythms. In addition to  recording and touring, since 1977 Philip has run his School of Magical Strings  in Seattle (and later Olalla) where he teaches harp and dulcimer.
<p>In 1988 Magical Strings dramatically expanded  their fan base when Dan Fogelberg requested that they join him on a summer tour  that took the duo to 30 major cities playing for crowds of up to 15,000.  Fogelberg later had them record on his album River  of Souls, and again, more recently, on his first Christmas album, released in  the fall of '99. The family quartet, including Brittany  on violin and Brenin on cello, toured Japan  in February/March '97, and again in &lsquo;99, performing ten sold-out concerts from Sapporo to Okinawa.  Magical Strings has appeared frequently on radio and television including CNN,  Japanese prime-time TV, and Garrison Keillor's &quot;A Prairie Home  Companion.&quot; Their music was used to launch General Motor's TV advertising  campaign for the Saturn car. 
<p>Philip Boulding's parents were university  professors, authors and peace activists. His father, Kenneth, was an economist;  his mother, Elise, a sociologist; and both were nominated for the Nobel Peace  Prize. Philip's family often traveled and he began his lifelong love for  islands during a childhood which included long intervals in Jamaica and Japan. Philip began his musical  education at age six studying classical violin, but switched to guitar at age  12. Shortly after he began building guitars in high school, he was captivated  by the sound of a hammered dulcimer. He immediately built a dulcimer and taught  himself to play it. When he moved to the Northwest in 1974 he fell in love with  the Celtic harp at a folk gathering. He submerged himself in Celtic music and  traveled to Ireland and Scotland to  research both ancient and current music and instruments. Philip has been a  professional musician since 1974, receiving training at the Boston Conservatory  and the University of Washington's Ethno-Musicology department, as well as  private study with classical and jazz harpists, a master of the Rumanian  cymbalom, an African kora player from Gambia,  and valiha masters from Madagascar.
<p>Pam began  playing piano at age four and studied classical music through high school. She  turned her attention to art at Pitzer College in Southern California  where she earned a B.A. in painting, sculpture and art history. Her paintings  have been widely exhibited and have received several awards. She has taught art  and music courses at various West Coast colleges and Waldorf schools. She  founded a summer art school for children in Maine, where she spent her childhood summers  sailing amongst islands with her family. Her father often inspired her with  music he brought back from his travels to many foreign lands. 
<p>Pam first  heard a hammered dulcimer being played in 1977. &quot;I knew instantly that I  had to play this instrument,&quot; she recalls. Unable to find a hammered  dulcimer after many months of searching, she decided to take a class at a  school that also provided an instrument to learn on. Philip was the teacher.  &quot;When we met, it was like we had known each other all our lives.&quot;
<p>&quot;I had  this dream,&quot; remembers Philip, &quot;to combine the harp and dulcimer into  one sound. When I met Pam, I realized she had a musical spirit similar to mine  and soon we were playing music together. It was like finding two complementary  halves and creating an aural texture that is unique and complete in its musical  expression. It allowed us to bring together the music we love -- Celtic, classical  and folk music from around the world -- and to create something uniquely our  own.&quot;
<p> Philip and  Pam recorded their first album titled Glass Horse in 1980, released on their  own label. This was followed by touring and seven top-selling albums on Flying  Fish Records -- <a href="http://www.magicalstrings.com/R-SpringTide.html">Springtide</a>, <a href="http://www.magicalstrings.com/R-AbovetheTower.html">Above The Tower</a>, <a href="http://www.magicalstrings.com/R-OntheBurren.html">On The Burren</a>, <a href="http://www.magicalstrings.com/R-Harp.html">Philip Boulding - Harp</a>, <a href="http://www.magicalstrings.com/R-CrossingtoSkellig.html">Crossing to  Skellig</a>, <a href="http://www.magicalstrings.com/R-GoodPeopleAll.html">Good  People All - A Celtic Yuletide Tradition</a> (features the entire family and  captures the spirit of their annual Christmas concerts held since 1978 in the  Pacific Northwest), and <a href="http://www.magicalstrings.com/R-BellOfftheLedge.html">Bell Off the Ledge</a>, <a href="http://www.magicalstrings.com/R-IslandsCalling.html">Islands Calling</a>, <a href="http://www.magicalstrings.com/R-Legend.html">Legend of Inishcahey</a> and <a href="http://www.magicalstrings.com/R-Moon.html">Beneath the Moon</a>. Later they recorded Where  Dragons Dance on Allegro&rsquo;s Alula label, followed by three double-CD solo  titles by Philip, the popular <a href="R-CelticMist.html">Celtic Mist</a> (solo  harp traditional music of Ireland, Scotland and Wales),<a href="R-Elegance.html"> Elegance of the Hammered Dulcimer</a>, and <a href="R-Celtic Holiday.html">Celtic  Holiday</a>, all released by Allegro. After Philip&rsquo;s self-released CD of solo harp originals, <a href="R-Musings.html">Musings</a>, they put out two more titles: <a href="R-Dances&Dreams.html">Dances and Dream - Best of Magical Strings</a> (2-CD set  compilation from their first nine recordings), and <a href="R-Celtic_Yuletide.html">Celtic  Yuletide</a> - Celebrating 31 Years Live!, comprised of live performances  from their 2009 Celtic Yuletide Concert season.               </font>
