                </font>Dear Friends,<br>
              As the quiet mists of autumn hearken the approach of winter, our
              memories stroll humbly through 25 full years of Yuletide performances
              with our family and friends! Not one of our five children has missed
              a single year with the exception of Brittany, our youngest, who
              is now a senior at Rice University's Shepherd School of Music.
              She was brought into the world in time to appear as the fairy princess
              at the 4th annual concert, thereafter an integral part of the ever-evolving
              Yuletide story. Now three generations strong, with a third grandchild
              on the way, our task is made more joyous, yet also pressing in
              the midst of a world trembling with conflict. Help us to kindle
              the light of renewal and joy, to cast fear aside and transform
              the darkness!
              <p>We invite you to join us in this grand festival of Celtic music
                and dance, verse, eurythmy, storytelling, juggling, and singing
                together. You may even choose to don a colorful costume and enter
                the merry Yuletide procession through the hall! From our recent
                travels to Ireland this fall we bring fresh inspiration to our
                music and a poignant Celtic tale with our harps, dulcimers, whistles,
                fiddles, pipes and all! We are delighted to share selections
                from our new CD, &quot;Where Dragons Dance&quot; -- so come with
                dancing spirit to our Yuletide gathering place where many paths
                converge to enter a magical realm, celebrate our common humanity,
                and hail the coming of light!</p>
              <p><strong><font size="3">More</font> News:<br>
                </strong><strong><font size="3">For</font> those of you who have
                followed our family and our work through the years, and anyone
                interested in perusing more details &#8216;behind the scenes&#8217; of

              <p><strong>Our Children</strong> - Without regard to chronology
                or preference, the following is an update on the Magical Strings
                offspring: Marshall, (harp player and one of the twins behind
                the CD table at Yuletide) and his wife Abby are expecting their
                first child in late November. They live on a beautiful Rhode
                Island farm, which we will visit at the conclusion of the Yuletide
                season to see our third grandchild! Twin brother and business
                partner Morgan (they design and build beautiful structures together
                in the East), who will be playing whistles and piano at Yuletide,
                is anxiously waiting to hear which medical school his wife Lara
                will choose, which will determine where they will reside next
                year. Geoffrey (fiddler and scientist) continues to enjoy teaching
                and running the electron microscopy lab at Central Michigan University
                while wife Erin works diligently on her Ph.D. in historical archeology.
                3-year-old Kailey is singing and dancing throughout the day preparing
                for Yuletide! Their family spent a week with us here on Magic
                Hill this summer, helping on the farm, having tea parties on
                the new grassy terrace under the holly trees, and taking in the
                beauty of the Northwest. Brenin our son who plays his soulful
                cello at all of our concerts and recordings lives close by with
                his wife Sara, leader of the Raney Irish Dancers, and their adorable
                3-year-old Rowan. Rowan and Pam once a week spend a morning together
                at a little Waldorf inspired nursery school in Seattle. Meanwhile,
                Brittany is practicing away in Houston where we will be on November
                15th for her <strong><a href="/Brittany.html">senior violin recital</a></strong>,
                a culmination and celebration of four years Rice University&#8217;s
                Shepherd School of Music! She graduates in May of 2004 -- our
                last one to complete her college years! We look forward to her
                special solo at this year&#8217;s Yuletide; she will be at every
                concert! </p>

                  <td><strong>Ireland Trip</strong> - Seven inspiring days this
                    September took us from Co. Clare to the Ring of Kerry and
                    Ballinskelligs Bay, where we were nurtured by our &#8216;spiritual
                    home&#8217; of Cill Rialaig, close to where Pam and I spent
                    our artist residency a few years ago. This place has inspired
                    many of our compositions over the years, from &#8220;Crossing
                    to Skellig&#8221; to our newest &#8220;Where Dragons Dance&#8221;.
                    We brought two of our student instruments, a harp (sold in
                    Ireland the first day we arrived!) and dulcimer. John at
                    Custy&#8217;s Traditional Music Shop in Ennis (with whom
                    we left the harp at the end of our trip) was exceedingly
                    kind and helpful to us. He pointed the way to a great pub
                    session that first night, at which I joined in with the little
                    harp and played to my hearts content! </td>

                    our travels we reconnected with Irish friends, and realized
                    that we had been away from this magical land far too long!
                    Nearing our last day, at the ancient Cill Rialaig monastic
                    site, I stood with the Oladion harp, recording the sound
                    of the wind blowing through the strings, creating the most
                    haunting music imaginable! It was there, overlooking Ballingskelligs
                    Bay that we began work on a new composition, which we are

            Our Studio Recording Experience</strong> was something unique in
            all our years of creating albums, as we had a narrow window of time
            to get the four of us (Brittany and Brenin with Pam and myself) into
            the studio, compelling us to record all of the quartet tracks live
            together. After recording the basic tracks, we were then free to
            add a few &#8216;overdubs&#8217;. One of my favorite moments, when
            Brenin was creating an innovative cello part to one of our traditional
            Irish jig medleys, was a comment that came from Brittany as she and
            I were standing outside the control room: &#8220;Daddy, you&#8217;re
            not going to let them get away with THAT are you?&#8221; We have
            worked with engineer/producer/musician/genius Billy Oskay for many
            years, but this was our first time in his new world-class &#8216;<a href="http://www.bigredstudio.com" target="_blank"><strong>Big
            Red Studio</strong></a>&#8217; in picturesque Corbett, Oregon near
            the Columbia Gorge with a view of Mt. Hood. The combination of beautiful
            surroundings and state-of &#8211;the-art equipment created a dream-inspired
            joyous experience for us. This mood is reflected in the music you
            will hear on the CD. (See the studio slide show on the &#8216;<a href="/WDD_Home.html"><strong>Dragons</strong></a>&#8217; homepage).
                          <p><strong>4th Annual Summer Harp Camp - </strong> Thirty
                            students gathered this August on Magic Hill to study
                            Celtic harp and hammered dulcimer, frequently gathering
                            under the shade of the apple trees outside the studio
                            in the balmy weather. On the parting day, profound
                            words were shared in a wide circle, expressing a
                            sense of community and a vision for working peacefully
                            in the world. Brenin helped create the gourmet vegetarian
                            meals over the long weekend (one of the big draws
                            of harp camp!). Unbeknownst to all of us, he was
                            also spending the last few days with Boris, our handsome
                            14-year-old golden retriever who came into our family
                            as a playful puppy thanks to Brenin. He had been
                            slowing down for sometime, and was mostly confined
                            to the back porch, as it was difficult for him to
                            walk. To our surprise, he came down to join everyone
                            during our festive evening around the campfire in
                            the pasture. We didn&#8217;t know that it was to
                            say goodbye. The next day, just as the last camper
                            left, Boris took his last breath in Brenin&#8217;s
                            arms, and we tearfully laid him to rest on top of
                            Magic Hill overlooking Puget Sound. Tristy, our other
                            14 year old Golden is lonely without him, but finds
                            consolation with Galoes and Gahmuret, our beautiful
                            twin black kitty cats, and the family of deer who
                            delight in sharing our bountiful harvest of apples
                            this fall. </p>
                          <p><strong>Harps, Lyres, Waldorf Schools and Classes
                              - </strong>Pam and I have once again entered our
                              fall time of teaching. Pam works with a young class
                              that comes to Magic Hill once a week to paint and
                              play the lyre and then goes to Seattle to teach
                              a lyre class at the Brightwater School in Seattle.
                              I travel to Seattle, Bellevue and Tacoma each week
                              for harp classes with our School of Magical Strings.
                              I am currently building 15 harps for students and
                              patrons. During this whole year there has been
                              no shortage of orders in spite of the economy.
                              My other harp-making friends tell me the same thing,
                              and we all agree that during difficult times people
                              find a way to do the things that bring more meaning
                              into their lives. There is a steadily growing interest
                              in the harp, and particularly in the new field
                              of thanatology, music for healing, for which the
                              harp is a natural and significant part. The world
                              is longing for healing and peace.</p>

                                    our family and friends. It is a way to bring
                                    joy, healing, and peace to the world; to
                                    see that we are not alone, but one humanity
                                    on a beautiful yet fragile orb, and so we
                                    tread gently to feel the needs of another,
                                    and stride boldly to part the veils of ignorance.
                                    It is the work of transformation and redemption
                                    from the humblest of places, and it only
