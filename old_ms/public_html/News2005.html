              <p><strong>Yuletide Greeting 2005<br>
                </strong>Dear Friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
                Glistening in the autumn mist, the holly trees of Magic Hill
                are adorned with bright red berries that remind us of this ancient
                symbol for the Yuletide season.&nbsp; We are grateful to all
                of you who have celebrated with us through the years, and invite
                you once again to join our colorful procession and three generations
                of artists:&nbsp; the <em>Boulding</em> clan on harps, dulcimers,
                violins, cello, whistles, concertina and more; songs of the season
                and rollicking reels with <em>Fiddlehead</em>, Northwest&rsquo;s
                premier Celtic trio on violin, guitar and Irish pipes; and the <em>Raney
                Family Irish Dancers</em> with their lightening-fast feet.&nbsp; Be
                mesmerized by the lyrical juggling of <em>Thomas Arthur</em> and
                thunderous percussion of <em>Jarrod Kaplan</em>.&nbsp; A magical
                tale of kings and shepherds will be graced by <em>eurythmy</em>,
                while <em>Mark Raney</em> with his warmth and humor will lead
                us in song and the hall will resound in glorious harmony singing
                all through the night.<br>
  <br>
                With cello and Irish dance our son Brenin and his family, Sara
                and 5-year-old Rowan will perform throughout the entire Yuletide
                season. We feel so fortunate that they live close by in Seattle
                where they work together managing the Raney family chemistry
                lab, and where Sara teaches at her Tara Academy of Irish Dance.
                Joining us for the final weekend will be the rest of our five,
                with a growing third generation. Geoffrey, Erin, 5-year-old Kailey
                and eleven-month-old Lindsey, will arrive just in time for the
                Tacoma concert. <br>
  <br>
                Geoffrey, our eldest and violinist, has recently accepted a position
                managing the Bio-imaging facility at Brown University in Rhode
                Island, where brother, builder and harp player Marshall along
                with Abby and two-year-old Margaret will welcome our fifth grandchild
                into the world in January of 2006. Morgan, who performs on field
                organ and pennywhistle will be arriving from his home in Philadelphia
                where his wife Lara is attending medical school. They have dreams
                of settling in the Northwest someday. <br>
  <br>
                Brittany, our youngest and professional violinist, gave a highly
                acclaimed performance of the Barber Violin Concerto as soloist
                in Breckenridge, Colorado this past summer. We were there! Brittany,
                in her second year of graduate studies at the Colburn Conservatory
                of Music in Los Angeles, just won a position in the Oakland Symphony
                and will be auditioning for major orchestras nationwide. As per
                tradition, her violin will sing out into the hall with a special
                solo for Yuletide. <br>
  <br>
                Magical Strings, the parents, have had a wonderful year of performing.
                We recently completed a very successful West Coast Fall tour
                and had a wonderful East Coast tour last spring &ndash; both
                of them allowing us the opportunity to spend precious time with
                our dear families who live much too far away.&nbsp; Brittany
                was able to join us on stage at our concert in Los Angeles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last
                winter we performed for many children throughout the country
                and, thanks to the South Kitsap School district, were able to
                give over 5,000 elementary children a hands-on experience with
                harps and dulcimers and treat them to some of our favorite Celtic
                tunes and original works in an assembly.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
                This year found Philip back in Billy Oskay&rsquo;s Big Red Studio
                recording three solo CD&rsquo;s, <strong><em>Celtic Mist, Celtic
                Holiday, and Elegance of Hammered Dulcimer</em></strong> for
                the Allegro label.&nbsp;  He also has just finished creating
                a beautiful new concert model harp which he will be taking over
                the mountains to Spokane for the our last Arts Festival of the
                year. We are thinking of naming it after one of our granddaughters;
                Rowan, Lindsey or Margaret. The Kailey Harp, named for our second-born
                granddaughter, has been a very popular model. Presently, there
                are many students coming to Olalla for harp classes at our School
                of Magical Strings and for private lessons.&nbsp; Magic Hill
                Summer Harp &lsquo;and Hammered Dulcimer&rsquo; Camp, by tradition
                occurring on the second weekend of August, was our best yet.
                We have been told by two of this past year&rsquo;s campers that
                learning to play the harp and dulcimer as a married couple can
                be quite enlivening and awakens a new and joyous journey of togetherness. <br>
  <br>
                In these times of dramatic world turbulence, Yuletide brings
                a message of healing and renewal.&nbsp; With our Celtic Yuletide
                festival we carry a flame of hope into the darkness of winter,
                to kindle that inner fire that carries us through the cold to
                the return of light.&nbsp; We hope you will come celebrate with
                us and revel in that joyous light which permeates everything
                with radiance&mdash;Celtic Yuletide!<br>
