              <font size=2 face="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"> 
              <p>With dancing hammers and pulsating strings, Philip and Pam Boulding 
                have created the distinctive music of Magical Strings, described 
                by The Washington Post as "warm, graceful and sonically gorgeous." 
                Centered around a tightly-knit blend of Celtic harps and hammered
                dulcimers, their performances are colorfully augmented by pennywhistles,
                concertina, valiha (Malagasy harp) and storytelling. Over the
                past 25 years they have drawn a large and loyal following worldwide,
                captivated by their energetic arrangements of Celtic music and
                their own engaging compositions, intertwining Celtic roots with
                classical/world music influences. <IMG SRC="Images/PamPhilip.gif" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=142 BORDER=0 ALT="Pam & Philip Boulding" align=right> 
              <p>Practically a household name in the Northwest, Magical Strings 
                has toured throughout the United States, Canada, the British Isles, 
                and Japan (winter '97) where, with their family quartet, including 
                Brittany and Brenin on violin and cello, stepdancing and juggling 
                to music, they performed ten sold-out concerts from Okinawa to 
                Sapporo. Philip and Pam have toured with Dan Fogelberg, sharing 
                their lively yet heart-felt music with enthusiastic crowds of 
                up to 15,000 a night in 30 major U.S.cities, and then recorded 
                on Dan's album, River of Souls. 
              <p>Since 1980 Magical Strings has recorded 12 albums on Flying Fish/Rounder, 
                EarthBeat Records, and their own label, Magic Hill Music, which 
                have received a growing stream of international airplay and acclaim 
                over the years. Islands Calling, hailed as "their best album yet" 
                by Billboard Magazine, features their family with several guest 
                artists including Alex de Grassi and Hawaiian slack-key virtuoso 
                Keola Beamer. <a href="R-Moon.html">Beneath the Moon</a>, Magical 
                Strings' latest recording takes you on a journey to sublime realms 
                of repose, where the very fount of healing springs forth. It begins 
                with a glorious symphony from the birds of Magic Hill as prelude 
                to "Rowan's Welcome," a new composition in honor of Philip and 
                Pam's first grandchild. This is followed by lullabies from previous 
                Magical Strings recordings, including such favorites as "Brittany's 
                Dream," "Song for My Mother," and "Lullaby for a Soul's Journey," 
                all specially re-mastered for this collection. Other new compositions 
                are the lilting "Reconciliation Waltz", a gentle offering of peace, 
                and "Lullaby for Kailey", written for the second granddaughter 
                born two months after Rowan. The album ends back on Magic Hill, 
                where the birds join the harp and carry the listener into a world 
                of dreams. 
              <p>Philip and Pam have performed on radio and television networks 
                around the country, including "A Prairie Home Companion", NPR's 
                Weekend Edition, CNN both at home and in Europe, and prime time 
                TV in Japan. They have placed first in a group competition in 
                Ireland, have collaborated with Northwest ballet and theatre companies, 
                and performed for Boris Yeltsin when he visited Seattle. In the 
                summer of '98 they returned to Ireland where they composed new 
                music as part of an artist residency in a cottage by the sea, 
                awarded to them by the Cil Rialaig Irish arts organization. 
              <p>The Bouldings run the well-known <a href="SchoolIndex.html">School 
                of Magical Strings</a>, inspiring students of the Celtic harp 
                and hammered dulcimer since 1978. They design and manufacture 
                <a href="HarpsDulcimers.html">instruments</a> for an international 
                clientele (over 2,000 built to date). Philip and Pam love to share 
                their music with children and have performed in schools throughout 
                the country, including Waldorf schools where for over ten years 
                they have taught harp, lyre, painting, and orchestra classes. 
                Called by local media the "Von Trapp Family of the Northwest", 
                their love of music is embraced by all five of their children 
                ages 20 to 31, who return from colleges and graduate schools across 
                the country to present their annual <a href="Calendar.html">Celtic 
                Yuletide Concerts</a> in cathedrals and concert halls throughout 
                the region. 
              <p>Philip and Pam seem to have boundless energy for their creative 
                life, which is nurtured by their home on a beautiful farm nestled 
                against Magic Hill, overlooking the Puget Sound.
