		      <em>The fairy wind of Irish lore reminds one of invisible  and mysterious forces in nature... &nbsp;and wind, like music, is unseen yet  wields profound influence upon our lives, giving glimpses into a magical world  that ever eludes us.</em></p>
			  <p>Track descriptions<br />
			      <br>
1. <a href="audio/Fairy Wind/Yellow_Bird.mp3" target="_blank">Yellow Bird</a><br>
When I was six  years old my father had a year&rsquo;s sabbatical and took us to Jamaica where I  first heard this song. This traditional Haitian melody is here arranged with a  little slack-key influence, reflecting two tropical island cultures.<br>
<br>
2. <a href="audio/Fairy Wind/Hardiman_Jigs.mp3" target="_blank">Hardiman  Jigs</a><br>
We heard these  jigs on a recent trip to the west of Ireland and have given them our  classic Magical Strings romp. &nbsp;The first is a slip jig, Hardiman the  Fiddler, followed by two jigs, Paddy Taylor&rsquo;s and Mairseail Alasdraim.</p>
                <p>3. Barbara&rsquo;s  Cottage<br>
                  A former harp  student invited us to stay in her beautiful cottage beside Lake Mask, Co. Mayo. In this picturesque setting we composed a piece  for her, our patron, in the style of 17th century Irish harper, Turlough  O&rsquo;Carolan.</p>
                <p>4. Fairy Wind ~ Si Gaoithe<br>
                  While sitting  on a high bluff overlooking Ballinskelligs   Bay at the 5th century  monastic site, Cil Riallaig, I was seeking inspiration when the wind began to  blow and created organ-like tones in multi-layered harmonics upon my harp strings.  My imagination carried me across the sea to a high ledge at the edge of the  world, where a monk sought wisdom in solitude, and I began improvising with the  wind. Our hostess that evening responded to my story by exclaiming &ldquo;Ah, that  was the fairy wind. &nbsp;It happens in Ireland, you know!&rdquo; </p>
                <p>5. <a href="audio/Fairy Wind/Mountain_Hermitage.mp3" target="_blank">Mountain  Hermitage</a><br>
                  After spreading  my mother&rsquo;s ashes along the trail to her hermitage, a mountainside cabin in Colorado, I found there on  a bookshelf the Appalachian dulcimer I had made for her so many years ago. To  my surprise it was in perfect tune, so I began to play and this medley came  forth.</p>
                <p>6. Celestial  Winds<br>
                  Our dear  friends, George and Celeste, sold their home and possessions and bought a sail  boat to explore the seas. &nbsp;They invited us to play for their wedding on Vancouver Island and to come a day early so that Pam could  share some of her sailing expertise. &nbsp;Alas, there was no wind, so we  composed this tune instead and played it the next day for their wedding aboard <em>Nereid</em>.</p>
                <p>7. My Lovely  Lady by the Sea<br>
                  During a  winter&rsquo;s sojourn on Maui, Pam found a  beautiful koa ukulele for me, so I composed this love song for her on my new  instrument. Can you hear the evening breeze in the palm trees and the waves  gently sounding on the sand?<br>
                </p>
                <p>8. The Hermit&rsquo;s  Cave<br>
                  Concealed in a  grove of hazelnut trees on a mountainside midst the Burren region of Co. Clare,  we found the cave of 6th century hermit St. Colman Mac Duach, as described to  us by our friend, Declan of Fergus View. &nbsp;Within this small dark space,  while reflecting on the colorful legends of his seven year penance, I began a  musical meditation on mystery and transcendence.</p>
                <p>9. Cape Clear<br>
                  We  spent a heavenly few days on this beautiful island off the southwest coast of County Cork. This haunting air fills us with longing to  return.</p>
                <p>10. Love&rsquo;s  Sweet Journey<br>
                  The magic of  our 38 years together, sharing music, love and an incredible family is  something I cannot easily put into words, so let the harp&rsquo;s own voice suffice.</p>
                <p>11. Lullaby for Elise<br>
                  While  playing the harp by my mother&rsquo;s bedside as she was preparing to dance off among  the stars, this lullaby came forth.</p>
                <p>12. The Blue Irishman<br>
                  I  was a blues man in my youth until I became irreversibly smitten by Irish music  via the dulcimer and harp in the early 70&rsquo;s. &nbsp;It just happened that one day  I &lsquo;heard&rsquo; a Mixolydian jig morphing into a 12-bar blues.</p>
                <p>13. Galloping Gertie/Caught in the Rain<br>
                  The  first Tacoma Narrows  Bridge became famous on a fateful day  in November, 1940 when nature&rsquo;s mighty winds created the perfect harmonic resonance  to bring her crashing into Puget Sound. Even during construction she made the workmen  nervous by her gyrations in the wind, hence the name, Galloping<br>
                  Gertie. You can hear the creaking  girders as I bend the dulcimer strings over the bridge! &nbsp;The second tune  describes a rain storm on Cape   Clear where, on our  return journey across the island, we became soaked to the bone while wading  through rushing streams which earlier in the day had been lovely trails.</p>
                <p>14.  Tigh Eamon<br>
                  Eamon was  a simple yet saintly man who lived in a small cottage (tigh) on the Burren.  During the day Eamon would  leave his door open for the birds to fly in and then feed them upon his table  whether they be robin or crow, and in the evening he would listen intently to  the traditional music of his famous brother, who often rehearsed with his band  in the cottage. Declan and Mary, who now own the cottage, invited us in and  shared many a story about this man.<br>
                  <br>
                  15. The Lonely Boat<br>
                  When I play this soulful air, learned  from the playing of piper Joe McKenna, I imagine a lone monk setting himself  adrift in a coracle and allowing the elements to take him to a place of  solitude and inspiration.</p><p></p></td>								<td valign=top align=center width="30%" bgcolor="#cccc99">						<font size=5 face="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica" color="#333366"><b>Recordings<br></b></font><br>						<div align="center"><IMG SRC="Images/Wheel100.gif" WIDTH=101 HEIGHT=101 BORDER=0 ALT="*"></div><br><br>
