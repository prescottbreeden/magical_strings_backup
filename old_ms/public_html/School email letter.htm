<p>Dear Fellow Harpers and Students&#8212;</p>
<p>Classes are starting up next week for the <strong>School of Magical Strings</strong>,
  (Seattle Tuesday, Feb. 17, Bellevue Wednesday, Feb. 18) and I want to encourage
  those of you who would like to take the beginning or intermediate
  class, but are facing obstacles to doing so&#8230; remember that in spite of
  hard times, music and art are as important to the soul as food and shelter
  are to the body! And the harp heals all wounds&#8230;</p>
<p>I would like to invite ALL those interested in the harp at any level to attend
  the first class in Seattle or Bellevue: the beginners, for a full-rounded introduction
  to the harp; and for returning students, a chance to get your harp fine-tuned,
  do some warm-up exercises and review. No charge and no commitment to continue
  with the class - and depending on the turnout, I may add another week to the
  course. As a further enticement to prospective intermediate students, we have
  recently returned from doing workshops and concerts on the &#8216;warm island&#8217; of
  Maui, and have some exciting new techniques relating to the gorgeous music
  of the traditional Hawaiian &#8216;slack key&#8217; guitar style, tailor-made
  for the Celtic harp!</p>
<p>If you think you might come, or have any questions, I'd appreciate hearing
  from you, but not required - just come! You can <strong><a href="http://magicalstrings.com/Form_Contact.php">CLICK

<p>Cheers and Aloha,</p>
<p>Philip Boulding<br>
