---
### Recordings
  * track listing for CDs (will probably animate a hide/show)
  * music player for listening to samples
  * shopping cart
---
### Events
  * This page will replace the calendar
  * Something contrasting to landing page slider

open to ideas here, could be:  
  * a stack of events that expand or hero sliders or whatever
  * importantly they don't have a lot of events, and I plan to make
    events auto remove after the date is passed which means this page 
    has the potential to have 0-2 events on it
  * highly doubt it will ever have more than 4 events on it but never know
---
### Donate*
  * external navigation to paypal (for now)
---
### Harp Shop
  * harp and hammered dulcimer products
  * shopping cart
---
### Contact Us
  * Probably put an extended bio here

### School of Magical Strings
I think it makes sense to combine this into a single page  
  * Classes
  * Assemblies and Workshops
  * Harp Camp
